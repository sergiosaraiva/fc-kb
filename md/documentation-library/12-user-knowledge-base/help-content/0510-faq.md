## User Guide

Line types: There are nine different Line Types that can be used in the User Reports. The Line Types that appear in the Report Definitions depend on the Report Types. Line Type Standard User Report, Flow User Report, Multi-Period Report, Cash-Flow Report. Account, Calculated Account, Text, Page Break, Header, Flow, Calculated Flow, Summation, Cash-Flow. Only the Line Types Text and Page Break are used in all User Report Types.

Using wildcards: Wildcards are special characters that can stand in for unknown characters when querying values from a list. There are two wildcards used in the application:
- * Matches any number of characters. You can use the asterisk (*) anywhere in a character string. Example: 123* finds 1234, 1237, 123456
- ? Matches a single letter in a specific location. Example: 123? finds 1234, 1237, but not 123456. This wildcard filter allows only 4-digit length.

In Financial Consolidation, you could use these wildcards to:
- Show all accounts that start with the same characters. Ex: 211* shows all accounts starting with 211 (211000, 211800, 211900 and 211950).
- Show all Consolidation Periods of the same category. Ex. *ACT* would show all Consolidation Periods with the text ACT in them, regardless of the position.
- Show all Consolidation Periods of the same sequence. Ex. *001 would show the first sequence of all Consolidation Periods.

The CSV file format: A comma-separated values (CSV) file is used to store data structured in a table or list form. Each line in the CSV file corresponds to a row in the table. Within a line, fields are separated by commas, each field belonging to one table column. Since it is a common and simple file format, CSV files are often used for moving tabular data between two different computer programs. CSV is a delimited data format that has fields/columns separated by a comma. The field delimiter is placed between each field of a record. Fields that contain a special character such as comma, newline, or double quote, must be enclosed in double quotes. The first record in a CSV file may contain column names in each of the fields: Year, Make, Model. Examples: 2008, Ford, Mustang. 2007, Chevrolet, Corvette. Any character or sequence of characters may be used to separate the values, but the most common delimiters are the comma, tab, and colon. The vertical bar, also referred to as pipe, and space are also sometimes used. Theoretically, when using another character than the comma, the file would be called a DSV (delimiter-separated values) file.

Examples:
Year, Make, Model, Options, Price.
1997, Ford, Mustang, ac abs, 18000.00.
1999, Chevy, Corvette, ac abs, 25000.00.
2008, Chevy, Corvette, C06, 50000.00.
1996, Jeep, Grand Cherokee, MUST SELL!, ac moon roof loaded, 4799.00.

This CSV example illustrates that:
Fields that contain the delimiter (commas, double-quotes, or line-breaks) must be quoted. A quote within a field must be accompanied with an additional quote immediately preceding the literal quote. A quote and a delimiter (comma within a field must be accompanied with an extra additional quote preceding the literal quote.
