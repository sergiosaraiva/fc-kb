Period locking
The Define Period Locking page allows you to set dates after which the import or input of specific types of data will be disabled. When you lock a period, it restricts any modifications to the selected data type for that period across all companies within the group. Administrators and Consolidators can modify locked data types after the period lock date has commenced. Six data types are available for locking: Closing Amounts, Intercompany, Flows, Intercompany Flows, Analytical Dimensions, and Adjustments.

Lock data: When data is locked, it is locked for all companies in the group and prevents changes to the selected data type for that period. Locking data type is different from when an administrator locks a period, which locks all data types for that period for all companies. Access the Define Period Locking page, click in the Data Locking Date field to specify a date, and select a date from the calendar. The default time of 12:00 AM appears in the time field, which can be changed. Optionally, select another data type and enter a lock date. Click to confirm.

Currency Exchange Rates
In the Financial Consolidation application, every account is set up to use a specific rate individually on an account-by-account basis. During the consolidation process, the application examines each account's configuration and selects the appropriate currency rate based on the company's currency and the period's currency. To access the Exchange Rates page, click Group > Exchange Rates. On this page, you can enter, import, or export currency exchange rates.

Enter a currency exchange rate: The Exchange Rates page is used for manually entering currency exchange rates for a consolidation period. These rates convert values from one currency to another in a selected period. The Exchange Rates tab presents the page divided into two panels: the Period Code panel on the left, showing a list of all consolidation periods, and the details panel on the right, showing details of available currencies for a selected period. The Currency table includes columns for CurrCode, Close, Average, and Month rates for both the Current and Reference Consolidation Periods, along with Modified By and Modified date and time.

To add a currency exchange rate: Select the consolidation period and currency. Optionally, display all currencies with or without amounts. Enter the Close, Average, and Month currency rates. Ensure the correct decimal symbol is used according to local or regional settings. Click to save changes. Errors will display a notification with details.

Print currency exchange rate report: The Currencies Reports tab contains the exchange rates of active currencies for the given period. Report types include Standard, Reporting, Statutory, and Current Period reports. To generate a report, select the type, base currency, and output file type. Click to generate the report and download the file.

Import exchange rates: To access the Import Exchange Rates page, click Transfers > Exchange Rates > Import Exchange Rates. You can import exchange rates from CSV, Excel, ECB (SDMX European Central Bank), and NBS (SDMX National Bank of Slovakia). The file format determines the parameters needed for the import. For CSV, specify the CSV Separator, Decimal Separator, Thousand Separator, and Text delimiter. Upload the file, view it, and transfer the data into the database. For Excel, specify the Sheet Name and Currency, upload the file, view it, and transfer the data into the database. For ECB/NBS, select the data source, currency pairs, period year, and month, then validate and import the rates. Ensure the import file meets the specified format.
