Status Board
The status board provides an at-a-glance view of all companies in the consolidation, including the status of the data entry process for each company.

The folder tree allows navigation through the structure created by the Administrator/Consolidator. The application administrator can grant rights to specific roles to access folders.

Select a consolidation period
In the Financial Consolidation application, the Current and Reference Consolidation Periods are displayed on top of every page. If the consolidation default period is not what you want, you can change to a different consolidation period.

Change a consolidation period: Click the Select Period icon beside the consolidation period you want to change. The User Settings page displays the consolidation periods with their codes, reference period codes, and names. A red lock indicates a locked period, and a black lock indicates an open period.

The selected periods are reflected in the Current Period and Reference Period fields. Click to confirm.

Filter the list of consolidation periods: Use filters to narrow down the list of consolidation periods with wildcards like ? and *. This is useful for viewing all periods of one year, or all periods with the same nature or sequence. Examples include typing 20* to see all periods from the 21st century, ACT to see all periods with the nature ACT, or 20 12ACT to see all periods from the 12th month of the 21st century with the nature ACT.

Period locking
The Define Period Locking page allows you to set dates after which the import or input of specific types of data will be disabled. When you lock a period, it restricts any modifications to the selected data type for that period across all companies within the group. Administrators and Consolidators can modify locked data types after the period lock date has commenced. Six data types are available for locking: Closing Amounts, Intercompany, Flows, Intercompany Flows, Analytical Dimensions, and Adjustments.

Lock data: When data is locked, it is locked for all companies in the group and prevents changes to the selected data type for that period. Locking data type is different from when an administrator locks a period, which locks all data types for that period for all companies. Access the Define Period Locking page, click in the Data Locking Date field to specify a date, and select a date from the calendar. The default time of 12:00 AM appears in the time field, which can be changed. Optionally, select another data type and enter a lock date. Click to confirm. On the set date, import or input of the locked data types is disabled in that period.

Unlock data: On the Define Period Locking page, click the data you want to unlock. In the Data Locking Date field, click to clear the lock date. Click to confirm.
