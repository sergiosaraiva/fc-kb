Terms and usage:
- Period: Consolidation period—a set period of time to manage (record and report) all financial transactions related to the companies in a group, usually written in this format: 202012ACT001. Version is a combination of the Category (ACT = Actual, BUD = Budget) and Version Number. When a consolidation period is initially created, the version number assigned to it is 000. If a consolidation period is duplicated, the version number increases to the next (incremental) e.g., 001. Typically, periods are set to begin and end based on calendar months of the year (12 months, yearly). They can however, be set to any length of time: 3 months, quarterly; 6 months, semi-annually, etc. There are two periods used in the application: Current and Reference. The Current and Reference consolidation periods appear on top of every page.
- Flows: Flows refer to transactional activities that impact the balance sheet and must be recorded for accurate cash flow calculation. Flows can be Cash (C) and Non-Cash (NC).
- Dimensions: Dimensions are optional hierarchical structures that are used to capture transactions and organize them in a way that allows an organization to gain additional insight into its financial data.
- Bundle: Bundle is used to describe the local data (accounting entries) of an entity or subsidiary.
- Conso: Consolidation.
- IC: Intercompany.

Filtering:
- You can filter lists by using in conjunction with the Search button. Wildcards are special characters that can stand in for unknown characters when querying values from a list. There are two wildcards used in the application:
- * Matches any number of characters. You can use the asterisk (*) anywhere in a character string. Example: 123* finds 1234, 1237, 123456
- ? Matches a single letter in a specific location. Example: 123? finds 1234, 1237, but not 123456. This wildcard or filter allows only 4-digit length.

Launching reports: All reports that are available in Financial Consolidation can be launched as PDF or Excel files, allowing you to print or save them for later use. When you click the View report button on a page, the report is generated and a hyperlink to the report is displayed. This hyperlink remains visible until you navigate away from the page.
