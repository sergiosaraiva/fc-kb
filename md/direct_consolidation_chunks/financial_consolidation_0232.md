# 6 . Currency translation principles

Groups often have subsidiaries in foreign countries, meaning that the individual accounts of these subsidiaries are then booked in foreign currency. It may happen that a parent company is located in a geographical area completely different than the majority of subsidiaries. Then it seems normal that the consolidated financial statement is expressed in the currency of the majority of the subsidiaries.

More often however, it is the currency of the parent company that is used as consolidating currency.

Following IFRS rules, the currency defined for each subsidiary is the functional currency, which is the main currency, used for business transactions. That functional currency can be different from the legal currency used for the statutory accounts.

The statutory accounts of subsidiaries must then be translated into the currency of the parent company which is also called the consolidation currency.

The information we receive from subsidiaries can be summarized mainly in several categories

The balance sheet accounts  
The P&L accounts  
- Notes to the accounts, including what we call flows, which are amounts explaining the evolution between opening and closing accounts. Flows can be seen as acquisitions, disposals, depreciations, transfers between accounts, ...

For these subsidiaries whose accounts are booked in foreign currency, we highly recommend to receive foreign currency information instead of information already translated into consolidation currency. The explanations developed in this chapter will show that this process of currency translation must be managed by the consolidation department.

How do we translate these three main categories of information?
