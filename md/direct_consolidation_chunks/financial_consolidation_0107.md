## 3.3 When different types of shares represent the capital of a company

We strongly advise for each individual company of the consolidation scope to get the following information:

The types and number of shares representing the capital ;  
- For each individual shareholders, the types and number of shares owned.

Let's explain this on the basis of the following example.

We consider a company C whose capital is represented by:

1000 shares of type 1 conferring, for each share, one voting right and a right to dividends  
- 1000 shares of type 2 conferring, for each share, a double voting right, but no right to dividends  
1000 shares of type 3 with non-voting rights and right to dividends

giving 3000 shares issued.

Let's suppose there is a single shareholder, namely the parent company P that owns:

1000 shares of type 1  
400 shares of type 2  
700 shares of type 3

giving 2100 shares owned.

The control percentage of company P in company C is calculated as follows:

\[
\frac {1 0 0 0 * 1 + 4 0 0 * 2 + 7 0 0 * 0}{1 0 0 0 * 1 + 1 0 0 0 * 2 + 1 0 0 0 * 0} = \frac {1 8 0 0}{3 0 0 0} = 6 0
\]

which is the ratio between owned voting rights and issued voting rights.

In practice, it is recommended not to limit to these arithmetical considerations.

One should also consider in particular

- The existence of a shareholder's agreement by which a majority shareholder abandons his voting rights for the minority shareholder. It will be for example the case when the majority shareholder plays a strictly financial role. In such situation, the choice is to maintain the control in the hands of the founding shareholder who, in most cases, is the person knowing about the technical products.  
- The existence of a de facto control as far as the minority shareholder is almost alone in front of absent shareholders during general annual meetings. Such situations take then the priority with regard to the arithmetical calculation explained above.

The direct financial percentages is given by the following ratio

\[
\frac {1 0 0 0 * 1 + 4 0 0 * 0 + 7 0 0 * 1}{1 0 0 0 * 1 + 1 0 0 0 * 0 + 1 0 0 0 * 1} = \frac {1 7 0 0}{2 0 0 0} = 85 %
\]

In such situation of various types of shares, direct financial percentage and direct control percentage may not be equal.
