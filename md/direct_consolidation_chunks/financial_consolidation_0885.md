### Specific assets accounts

Goodwill with a necessary distinction between gross value and depreciation or impairments  
Financial investments in consolidated companies to separate from financial investments in non consolidated companies. Four different accounts should be defined:

o Acquisition value  
o Uncalled amounts  
Revaluations  
Write-offs

The first two accounts are cash and the last two accounts are non cash. Moreover, the only variations accepted in a consolidation process are acquisitions, disposals and payment of uncalled amounts. Revaluations and write-offs, even if they are naturally booked at statutory level, are amounts to eliminate in the consolidation process.
