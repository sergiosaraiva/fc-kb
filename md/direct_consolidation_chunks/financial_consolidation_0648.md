## Content

## Context:
- P's ownership increased from 80% to 83.33%
- P initially owned 800 shares out of 1,000
- Dividend distribution: 1 new share for every 4 existing shares
- P received 200 new shares (800 ÷ 4)
- New ownership: (800 + 200) / (1,000 + 200) = 1,000 / 1,200 = 83.33%
- This affects consolidation calculations for Year 2


We now show the statutory accounts of each company, already including statutory bookings related to the dividends and the necessary consolidation adjustments.

Let's understand the statutory bookings first

In company P, booking (1) shows there is a profit (financial income) for 320 corresponding to the  80%  of the gross dividends of 400 proposed by A. But A pays also 0.2 per each new share, so  40 = 0.2^{*}200  which represents a cash payment (Other assets).

The total of  360 = 320 + 40  is booked as a debit on the financial investment.

In company A booking (2) shows the  80 = 20%  * 400 cash paid to  3rd  Parties as dividends.

Booking (3) shows that the dividends for company A, that is  320 = 80%  400, are transferred from Reserves account to Capital account.

Booking (4) is related to the additional payment of 40 which is considered as a Share premium. We could also book it on the Capital account and it would make no difference from a consolidation point of view.

There are also consolidation adjustments to book in company P

Adjustment (a) eliminates the financial income corresponding to the dividends for an amount of 320, just as we would do for normal dividends as discussed in Part 2.

Adjustment (b) needs some explanations because of a percentage variation.

The approach we apply works perfectly well each time there is such variation.

First we calculate the group equity before the transaction, that is

\[
80 % * [ 1000 + 800 + (200) + (400) ] = 960
\]
