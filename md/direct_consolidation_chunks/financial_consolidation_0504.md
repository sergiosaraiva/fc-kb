### Non cash flows from the consolidation process

A particular attention should be brought to quite a large number of situations linked to consolidation. It is rather difficult to give a complete list of these situations, however here are some of the main topics

- When consolidating a company for the first time, all assets and liabilities in the balance sheet at the date of acquisition will not impact the cash flow statement. What the group is acquiring are the shares of that company and not its assets and liabilities. The same comment can be made in case of disposal of a company.

- For all changes in consolidation method for a certain company, we are faced to a similar problem. Let's take an example. In Year 1, a company A is consolidated by the proportional integration at  50%  and in Year 2 by the global integration method with  80%  for the group. Clearly, in the consolidated balance sheet, we show  50%  of the assets in Year 1 and we show  100%  in Year 2. Again, that variation cannot appear in the cash flow statement for the same reason: the cash transaction is the acquisition of additional shares of company A giving the control. That's the only cash information to show.

- When two companies in a group are merging, all assets and liabilities of one of these companies are brought to the other company. Most of the time, there is no financial transaction between the two merged companies and the cash flow statement must show nothing about it. We are in a situation of transfer accounts but not inside a single company but between two companies.

- When a company A owned at  80%  by its parent company P, increases its capital for an amount of 100 and supposing 80 is subscribed by P and 20 by the  3^{rd}  Parties, this transaction is partly internal to the group for 80 and external to the group for 20. Indeed, 80 is just moving from the P bank account to the A bank account and the remaining 20 represents cash from  3^{rd}  Parties. Only this amount will appear in the cash flow statement.

- The next situation is quite similar to the increase in capital. A company A owned by parent company P at  80% , is paying a dividend of 100. An amount of 80 is paid to P and 20 to the  3^{rd}  Parties. For the same reason as explained above, only (20) will appear as cash out in the cash flow statement.

- When explaining the currency translation on flows, in Part 1, we mentioned the booking of a translation adjustment flow on each assets and liabilities account for all foreign companies, because of the use of different rates. These flows will not appear in the cash flow
