# Company DELTA

Equity analysis confirms the payment of dividends for 400 CUR. As stated before, company ALPHA receives  240\ \mathrm{CUR} = 60%  * 400 CUR booked for a value of 150 EUR.  
- We remind that the provisions still include an amount of 300 CUR to be eliminated. These provisions have already been adjusted during Year 1 consolidation. This means that the adjustment has to be maintained.  
- The intercompany payables of 1250 CUR with partner ALPHA correspond to the intercompany receivables booked in ALPHA accounts. This means the difference that will be noticed after currency translation is to be considered as an exchange gain or loss.  
- The same comment can be made for the intercompany purchases with ALPHA for an amount of 5200 CUR.

Let's now proceed to the consolidation of Year 2 like we did for Year 1.
