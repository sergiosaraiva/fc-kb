# We suppose interim dividends are not paid

Sometimes, an interim dividend is decided during the last days of the year, depending on company final profit, with a payment during the first days of next year.

This situation leads to the following recommended booking


| Accounts before interim dividends |  |  | Accounts after interim dividends (not paid) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| P |  |  | P |  |  |
| Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital 200 | Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital 200 |
|   |   | Reserves 100 |   |   | Reserves 100 |
|   |   | Result 30 |   |   | Result 30 |
| Cash | 420 | Other liabilities 170 | Receivables/A | 8 | 8 |
|   |   |   | Cash | 420 | Other liabilities 170 |
| A |  |  | A |  |  |
|   |   | Capital 100 |   |   | Capital 100 |
|   |   | Reserves 50 |   |   | Reserves 50 |
|   |   | Result 20 |   |   | Result 20 |
| Cash | 400 | Other liabilities 230 | Cash | 400 | Other liabilities 230 |
|   |   |   | Payable/P | 8 | Payable/Others 2 |


In company A, there is a debit on Reserves account and a credit on Payables, but 8 out of 10 is defined as an intercompany amount with P, the remaining 2 are paid to  3^{rd}  Parties.

In P accounts, the amount of 8 is booked on a Receivables account defined as intercompany with A.

Payables and Receivables will thus not appear in the consolidated accounts because of the intercompany eliminations.

Moreover, the same comment can be done for the Reserves account which has an impact of zero in consolidation.
