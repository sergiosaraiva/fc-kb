### 1 The slow evolution of consolidation requirements

While the first holding companies, true economic conglomerates present in the international sphere, were already appearing in the second half of the 19th century, it took until 1904 for consolidated accounts to be put on the

agenda of the first international accounting congress. Publications on the topic first appeared in the United States in 1918.

It took Europe much longer to become aware of the usefulness of these publications. Great Britain took the lead over other European countries and issued rules for consolidated account publication in 1939, but only made them compulsory much later with a 'Companies Act' in 1948.

In France, despite studies and some concrete proposals from 1954 on, a first decree was issued in 1967 which, however, only provided for the possibility of attaching consolidated accounts to the ordinary accounts of holding companies.

It wouldn't be right to leave out the international actions organised in parallel with these converging national rules, particularly in the 1970s. We should note that:

- In 1973, the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), representing the main accounting organisations of a large number of countries, issued Standard number 3 which stated that a parent company must publish consolidated accounts.  
- The United Nations, within a commission of international companies founded in 1974, expressed its wish to see the ordinary accounts of large groups completed by consolidated accounts.  
- And, lastly, in 1976, the OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) issued recommendations on the publication of consolidated information as part of its declaration on international investments and multinational companies.

However, it took until June 13, 1983 for the 7th European Directive on consolidated accounts to appear, which asked for its implementation in all Member States before January  1st , 1988 and to publish consolidated accounts applicable, however, to the fiscal period beginning after January  1st , 1990.

This was the legislative framework in which the first consolidations were done.

#### 1.1 The 1970s: The pencil and eraser age

If a historian had to describe the consolidations done by the pioneering holding companies which chose to publish their consolidated accounts at the end of the 1960s, they would refer to it as the pencil and eraser age.

Personal computers didn't exist and spreadsheets were unheard of. Consolidation principles were not yet sufficiently well mastered to give rise to specialised software.

At most, some consolidators used accounting programs (no one talked about software at the time and even less about software packages) in which they piled company accounts as long entries of asset debits to liabilities credits and, when they were able to, via a screen. At the time, punch cards were still very much used as a data entry medium.

Office calculators were an indispensable tool both for currency exchanges (the euro didn't exist yet!) and for establishing all of the elimination entries.
