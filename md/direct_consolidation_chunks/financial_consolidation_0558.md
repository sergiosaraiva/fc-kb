# Chunk 558: Key Points:

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes. Contains formula: that is  40 = 100%  * 40 which represents a cash out for P  .

## Content

## Key Points:
- P subscribes disproportionately to increase ownership
- Subscription (40) exceeds P's proportional share (20 = 40% × 50)
- Results in 10% ownership increase
- Impacts consolidated cash flow statement


On January  1st , Year 2, company A increases its capital by 50 for which P subscribes 40 and the  3rd  Parties 10. By subscribing in a proportion different from the existing percentages, the participation of P is increasing by  10% . We should normally study this increase of capital based on the number of shares but for the scope of this case, it brings nothing additional.

When we look at a consolidation software, we usually find two flows impacting the cash flow statement

The amount of capital the group subscribes, that is  40 = 100%  * 40 which represents a cash out for P  
The amount of capital maintained in the group as being  25 = 50%  50

giving a net impact of (15) = (40) + 25.

This amount is either correct or not depending on the consolidation method defined for Year 2 as shown hereunder


|   | Global integration | Proportional integration | Equity method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Subscription | (40) | (40) | (40) |
| Capital increase | 50 = 100% * 50 | 25 = 50%*50 | 0 = 0% * 50 |
|   | 10 | (15) | (40) |


Again, we have to think cash.

For the global interaration method, the bank account of A is integrated at  100%  of its value in the consolidated figures and the net impact of the capital increase is the cash of 10 brought by the  3^{rd}  Parties.

For the proportional integration method, the bank account of A is integrated at  50%  of its value in the consolidated figures and the net impact of the capital increase is now (15), a negative amount. The group gives 40 but receives only 25 in return.

For the equity method, the bank account of A is not integrated in the consolidated figures and the net impact of the capital increase is zero. The group gives 40 and receives nothing in return.
