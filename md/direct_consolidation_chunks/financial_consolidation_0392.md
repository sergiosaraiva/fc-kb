### Capital

For a "normal" group with a unique parent company, the capital item shows only the parent company capital. As already explained, capital amounts from all other companies are just eliminated against the consolidated reserves.

This means that the evolution of this account, after consolidation, reflects only the changes at parent company level, mainly increase or reimbursement of capital and, possibly, transfer from Reserves to Capital.

For a group structured as a consortium, with two or more parent companies, the capital amount is the addition of the capital of each company in the consortium.

In most countries, capital is presented as 'Subscribed capital' and 'Uncalled capital' on separate lines, sometimes the "Uncalled capital" may be booked as an asset.

In the consolidated accounts, these two sub-items are aggregated.
