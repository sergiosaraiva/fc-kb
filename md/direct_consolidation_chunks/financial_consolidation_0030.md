### 1.2 Financial consolidation statements

In this context of group where several companies act in close dependence, the activity of one is so influenced by another that the appreciation of a single company has a restrictive nature. It seems then more natural to build up an opinion not on an isolated company but either on the parent company or on all individual companies belonging to the group.

For an external observer, the only available information can be found in the statutory annual accounts reports of every individual company. Two approaches can be considered from then on:

- Either we consider only the parent company statutory accounts as better image of the group  
- Or we consider the statutory accounts of all the companies of the group, including those of the parent company.

The first approach presents three major inconveniences:

- First, it supposes that the book values of the financial participations reflect faithfully the value of every owned company, which is not generally the case. Such an owned company sees its own capital evolving depending on its profits generated at the end of every year while the financial participations booked in the parent company accounts do not generally record that evolution  
- Then, it supposes that the profit of every company appears in the financial products of the parent company, in the form of received dividends. It is clear that, in the majority of the cases, the share dividends paid by a company reflects only partially the profit which is generated during the previous year  
- Finally, it masks any vision on companies owned indirectly by the parent company, because these do not simply appear in its accounts, neither in terms of participations nor in terms of received dividends.

The second approach consists in considering the statutory annual accounts of each company and to accumulate them with those of the parent company. Here also the inconveniences are of importance:

- The annual accounts of foreign companies lead straightaway to wonder as for the choice of adequate exchange rates to be applied to these foreign currency accounts.  
In particular how to handle the balance sheet accounts which, from a period to the other one do not evolve, but fluctuate by the only phenomenon of different exchange rates.  
- Inevitable duplications appear, because of simple accumulation, between receivables which the group owns on itself, between purchases which it concluded with himself and come to inflate artificially its total of assets, liabilities, its revenues and expenses  
- Dividends, before being paid, belongs to the result of a company but are booked, next year, in the financial income of the shareholders of that company  
- Finally let us point out that it seems at least abnormal that the accounts of company not controlled by the parent company are considered on the same foot as those of a company controlled by that parent company.
