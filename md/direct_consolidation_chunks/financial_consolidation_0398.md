## Grants

In IFRS, grants are considered as debts and do not appear as equity. In Local Gaap, grants may be booked directly in equity because they correspond to

not refundable cash received from some state organization. So it is indeed not a debt...

Basically, this account is changing between opening and closing periods for two reasons: first for new grants received and secondly for part of grants to book in P&L, depending on the depreciation plan of the assets for which these grants have been received.

From a consolidation point of view, the consolidated amount of grants is the indirect financial percentage in the grants of each company, including grants of parent company.

If a percentage variation appears between opening and closing, the same principles as for Revaluation reserves apply again.
