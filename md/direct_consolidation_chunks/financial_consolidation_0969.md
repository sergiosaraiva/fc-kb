## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Contains formula: CUR = 0.8 EUR  . Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

## Key Information:
- BETA acquired 3 years ago with goodwill of 500
- Goodwill depreciation: 20% per year
- Accumulated depreciation Year 1: (300)
- DELTA requires currency translation from CUR to EUR


Three of these companies are presenting their accounts in EUR and DELTA accounts are in a certain foreign currency CUR.

So EUR will be the consolidation currency.

Considering the percentages (control  % =  financial %), all three subsidiaries are consolidated with the global integration method.

For this first year, following events should be known:

- Company BETA has been acquired in January three years ago with a goodwill of 500. This goodwill is depreciated with a rate of  20%  a year. At the end of Year 1, we thus have a depreciation amount of (300) in the assets.  
- When acquiring BETA, the due diligence identified a tangible asset to be revaluated for an amount of 1000. It is depreciated by  10%  each year. At the end of Year 1, we so have a total depreciation of (300) in the assets.  
- Company GAMMA was acquired also in January four years ago with a goodwill of 700. This goodwill is depreciated with a rate of  20%  a year. At the end of Year 1, we thus have a depreciation amount of (560) in the assets.  
- DELTA statutory accounts include a provision of 300 CUR which is not compatible with the group evaluation rules. This provision has been eliminated for the first time this year and booked in the statutory P&L.  
- DELTA accounts are translated into EUR with the following rates (CUR/EUR):

Closing rate: 1 CUR = 0.8 EUR  
Average rate: 1 CUR = 0.7 EUR  
Historical rate for capital account : 1 CUR = 0.9 EUR  
Historical rate for retained earnings : 1 CUR = 0.85 EUR

In Year 2, some structure changes transform the ALPHA group slightly, as shown here below.
