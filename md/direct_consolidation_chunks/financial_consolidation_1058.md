Both Year 2 contribution and Year 1 consolidated accounts are displayed for comparison reasons.

Here are the most important comments we can make:

- The gross value goodwill has decreased because of the disposal of the  40%  shares of GAMMA  
However, there is a new goodwill booked in BETA accounts concerning the acquisition of company MU  
- Lands account is changing from 2000 to 1000 thanks to the fact that GAMMA is now consolidated with the equity method. Moreover, the group disposal from ALPHA to BETA has no impact on the Year 2 consolidated accounts.
