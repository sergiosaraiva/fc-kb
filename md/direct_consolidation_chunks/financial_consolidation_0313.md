## Consolidation of Year 2

With the same arguments as for the classical dividend seen in previous section, we have to eliminate in the parent company profit the part of that dividend that was included in the Year 1 profit of company A. We are speaking about  80%  * 100 CUR * 1.3 = 104 EUR.

But P has received an amount of dividend of 110 EUR as mentioned initially. From a consolidation point of view, we consider two amounts: 104 corresponding to the dividend and 6 considered as an exchange gain. Theoretically speaking, P should have received exactly 104. If more it is indeed a gain, if less it is a loss.

Here is the adjustment eliminating that dividend


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Financial income (dividends) | 110 |   |
| Exchange gain |   | 6 |
| Reserves |   | 104 |


and we can see that we eliminate the 110 from the Financial income but we reclassify 6 on the Exchange gain, corresponding to a correct view for

consolidation. Reserves are impacted only by the dividend amount valuated at average rate of Year 1.

The reason to proceed that way is, in particular, for audit purpose. It is indeed more easy to check that this specific account has been set to zero.

Let's now consider parent statutory accounts and the consolidated accounts, including that adjustment.


| P (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 800 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 1,150 |   |   |
| (a) | 104 |   |   |
| Result | 450 |   |   |
| (a) | (104) |   |   |
| Other assets | 5,300 | Other liabilities | 2,500 |



| P + A (Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 2,000 |
|   | Reserves | 1,254 |
|   | Result | 346 |
|   | Conso. Reserves (A) | 1,040 |
|   | Minor. Interests (A) | 608 |
|   | Trans. Adj. | 592 |
| Other assets | 13,940 | Other liabilities |
|   |   | 8,100 |


#### where

- Consolidated Reserves (A) = 1040 = 80% * [1600 + (400) + 960 + (280) + 480 + (60)] - 800  
Minority Interests (A) = 608 = 20% * [1600 + (400) + 960 + (280) + 480 + (60) + 400 + 280 + 60]  
Translation Adj. = 592 = 80% [400 + 280 + 60]
