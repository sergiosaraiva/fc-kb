### Adjustment J3

We know that the capital of company B has been increased by 500 and that each shareholder has subscribed according to its percentage. Company P brings  560 = 70%  * 800 to company B and the  3^{rd}  Parties the remaining 240 = 30% * 800. The 560 must be considered as a cash transfer between companies with no effect in the cash flow statement.

The counterpart is the financial investment of (860) that must be adapted to be only (300) corresponding to the cash paid to  3^{rd}  Parties for the acquisition of the  70%  shares of company B.
