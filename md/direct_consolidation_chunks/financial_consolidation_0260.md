### The adjustments

There are two different consequences when speaking about the non respect of a cut-off procedure.

First consequence: Company A sends an invoice which is not booked by the partner B within the required reporting delays needed for consolidation. In such situation, the invoice has to be booked in company B accounts through a consolidation adjustment. This is what we have in fact already explained in point 7.2.1. But this situation has to be analyzed a little deeper depending on the type of transaction. Let's consider the two following examples.

First example: we suppose that the invoice is related to some R&D activities. The question is how these R&D costs have been booked in B accounts? If they have been considered as intangible assets and depreciated over a certain period, is that compatible with the group rules? If not (IFRS), depreciations must be reversed and the total R&D costs have to be booked in P&L.

Second example: Let's suppose the invoice is related to some stocks disposed from company A to company B. These stocks are not in company A accounts any more, but they are not yet in B accounts and nevertheless these stocks didn't leave the group. More precisely, the stocks are in a truck somewhere on a highway! The consolidation adjustment has to debit the stock in company B accounts.

Second consequence : Company A has sent an invoice to company B quite a long time before the end of the year and transactions are correctly booked in both companies accounts. But the problem is that company B pays this invoice the last day of the period. It is not recorded in A accounts in the same period. In such situation, the consolidation adjustment consists in a credit on the Receivables account and a debit on the Cash account of company A.
