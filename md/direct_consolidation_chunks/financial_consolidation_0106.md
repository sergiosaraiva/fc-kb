Indeed, the indirect financial percentage in company C4 is calculated as follows

- Path 1: P -> C1 -> C4: 80% * 30% = 24%  
- Path 2 : P -> C2 -> C4 : 60% * 20% = 12%  
- Path 3 : P -> C3 -> C4 : 40% * 20% = 8%  
- Path 4 : P -> C4 : 10%

giving a total indirect financial percentage of  24% + 12% + 8% + 10% = 54% .
