| Approach 1 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Company A | 70 | 0 | 0 | 70 |
| Company B | (40) | (40) | 60 | (20) |
| Total | 30 | (40) | 60 | 50 |



| Approach 2 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Company A | 0 | 0 | 70 | 70 |
| Company B | (30) | (30) | 40 | (20) |
| Total | (30) | (30) | 110 | 50 |


The total contribution of each company in the P&L over these three years is the same in both approaches: 70 for A and (20) for B. But the contribution for each year is quite different. In fact, in approach 2, profit is taken in P&L only when the asset leaves the group. Before that, the principle of prudence is applied.
