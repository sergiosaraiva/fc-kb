### Chanae of financial verventae from 80% to 60% durina Year 2

We know that company A profit for the first six months of Year 2 is 50. As, at the end of Year 2, the financial percentage is  60% , the consolidation process will apply this percentage to the full year, including the 50.

Most of the consolidation software on the market are processing this way, which needs the following adjustment.

Indeed, the group profit for the first six months is 40 ( = 80% * 50 ) instead of 30 ( = 60% * 50 ). This means 10 is missing in the group profit at the end of Year2. And these 10 are given to the  3rd  Parties!.

Here is the adjustment correcting this wrong situation

Debit Credit

Reserves

Group result

Minority interest result

Minorit. interests

It is called a 'after  3rd  Parties" or "top" or "group" adjustment because, regardless of the fact that it is booked in company A accounts, owned at  60% , these amounts must be considered as impacting each account at  100% .

We see that we give an additional profit of 10 to the group and we reduce the  3rd  Parties profit for the same amount.

In the balance sheet, the impact of that adjustment can be seen on group sides because it consists in a transfer between reserves and result but we see nothing on the  3^{rd}  Parties side because Minority interests reserves and result are aggregated.

In the P&L, there is no impact on expense and income accounts, but just a transfer between Minority result and Group result, generally on the two last lines.
