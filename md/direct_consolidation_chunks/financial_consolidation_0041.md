## Third category example: 'Technical' adjustments

This category of adjustments is easy to define. If, for a certain event, an adjustment is not booked, there will be for sure a technical mistake in the consolidation.

Amongst the events, we can state all group structure changes like acquisitions, disposals, increase in capital, ...

What is the impact in the consolidation?

We consider the parent company acquiring  100%  of a new company for a price of 100. Equity of the acquired company is 80.

There will be a goodwill of 20, which is the difference between the acquisition price of 100 and  100%  of the equity of 80.

In parent company, we have to book a goodwill of 20 and, depending on the evaluation rules, to depreciate this goodwill or to book an impairment on this goodwill.

Of course, before calculating the goodwill, we have to adjust the accounts of the acquired company to make them compliant with the group rules.

Most of the time, consolidation adjustments remain in the consolidation accounting for a long period of time. That means these adjustments need to be well documented because one should check if the corresponding statutory amount still corresponds to the effect of the adjustment.
