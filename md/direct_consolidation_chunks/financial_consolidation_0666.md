## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Includes practical examples. Discusses relationships between entities: P.

## Content

## Consolidation Considerations:
1. **Indirect ownership**: P owns 48% of B (60% × 80%)
2. **Method choice**:
   - Accept A+B consolidated accounts, or
   - Consolidate A and B individually
3. **Evaluation rules**: Must verify if A+B uses same standards as P (e.g., IFRS)
4. **Historical adjustments**: Goodwill, revaluations, provisions from A+B history
5. **Transparency**: Individual vs. combined contribution visibility
