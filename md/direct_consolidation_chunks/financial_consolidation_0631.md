## 2.1 Capital increase with a change of financial percentage during the consolidation period

We first consider a parent company P owning  100%  of the shares of a company A. If A decides to increase its capital by 100, P will subscribe this amount and nothing will happen in the consolidation. The consolidated reserves of A become  100%  * equity before increase + 100 - (financial investment + 100) and the 100 has no impact.

Considering the cash flow statement, we have also seen that 100 is just moving from P bank account to A bank account. Both being consolidated, no cash impact will appear.

Now, if P owns only  80%  of A but the capital increase is subscribed by both P and the  3^{rd}  Parties in the proportion of  80%  and  20% , again such situation will have no impact on the consolidated reserves for the same reason as above. On the cash flow statement side, we notice a cash in for  20 = 20%  * 100.

However, other situations become a little more difficult, mainly for the two following reasons

- P, owning  80%  of A agrees to subscribe the capital increase but the  3rd  Parties deny. This will imply a percentage variation if P subscribes the total amount of capital increase on its own.  
- If that capital increase, with a percentage variation, occurs during the consolidation period, and not on the first day, the group profit of the year of company A must be calculated with the percentage 'before'

and 'after". We need to know the results before and after capital increase. Of course, this will apply for significant amounts.

The case we analyze hereunder includes these two issues.
