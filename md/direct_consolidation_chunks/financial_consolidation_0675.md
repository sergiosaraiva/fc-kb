Adjustment (a): Gross goodwill as calculated in Year 0 when acquiring the subgroup. This goodwill is unique for both companies A and B.

Adjustment (b): Cumulated depreciations on the goodwill. 20% in Year 0  
booked on the Reserves account and 20% in Year 1 booked in the P&L.

Adjustment (c): Revaluation of tangible assets, corresponding to a partial allocation of the goodwill.

Adjustment (d): Cumulated depreciations of the revaluation as  10%  booked on the Reserves account and  10%  booked in the P&L.

Here are the consolidated accounts


| P + A + B |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 216 | Capital | 1,500 |
| Reserves | 428 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 1,400 | Result | 228 |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 460 |   |   |
| Equity value (B) | 680 | Conso. Res.(B) | 180 |
| Other assets | 4,500 | Other liabilities | 4,000 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = 460 = 100% * [1000 + 500 + 500 + (50) + 200 + (50)] - [2000 + (360)]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = 180 = 40% * [1000 + 500 + 200] - 100% * 500  
Equity value (B) = 680 = 40% * [1000 + 500 + 200]

In this consolidation, there are no  3^{rd}  Parties.
