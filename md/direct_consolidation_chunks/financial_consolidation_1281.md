### Answer 3.10

Let's suppose the unknown acquisition price for the  30%  is  X  and the resulting goodwill is  G .

We are now able to calculate the consolidated equity used in the ratio, which is

Equity of parent company  = 3000  
- Consolidated reserves of company  A = 70% * 2000 - [1000 + X - G] = 400 - P + X  
Minority interests of company A = 600 = 30% * 2000

giving a total of  4000 - X + G .

But, in order to comply with Bankers requests, we have to reduce the equity by the goodwill. Consolidated equity becomes 4000 - X.

After global integration, debts become  4000 = 2000 + 2000  and the ratio "Debt/Consolidated equity" is  4000 / [4000 - X] = 2 .

We easily find  X = 2000 .
