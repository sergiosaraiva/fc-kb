### Payment of a dividend by a company in foreign currency

This situation is quite similar to the previous one.

We consider a foreign company A (currency CUR) paying a dividend and this is reflected in the following accounts limited to the ones strictly necessary for our explanations.


| Company A (CUR) Closing rate Average rate | Year 1 [5] [6] | Net variation [7] | Dividends paid [6] | Transfer [6] | Year 2 [8] [7] |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Cash | 200 | (40) |   |   | 160 |
| Reserves |   |   |   | 160 | 160 |
| Result | 200 |   | (40) | (160) | 0 |


We see the dividends paid in cash is 40 CUR.

The particular issue we have here is that, in consolidation, the currency translation process translates the "Dividends" flow at average rate of Year 1 while the "cash" flow is translated at average rate of Year 2.

The reason to proceed this way has been explained in Part 2 - Chapter 6.


| Company A (EUR) | Year 1 | Net variation | Dividends paid | Transfer | CTA | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Cash | 1,000 | (280) |   |   | 560 | 1,280 |
| Reserves |   |   |   | 960 |   | 960 |
| Result | 1,200 |   | (240) | (960) | 0 | 0 |
| CTA | (200) |   |   |   | 520 | 320 |


In the accounts translated in EUR here above we can immediately notice that something is wrong by the fact that the total of CTA assets is not equal to the total of CTA liabilities.

Moreover, to be consistent, the value of the dividends translated at average rate Year 1 should be the expected cash out, which is not the case.

Again, a consolidation adjustment should reclassify some CTA on flow amounts as hereunder


| Company A | Year 1 | Net variation | Dividends paid | Transfer | CTA | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Cash | 1,000 | (280) |   |   | 560 | 1,280 |
|   |   | 40 |   |   | (40) |   |
| Reserves |   |   |   | 960 |   | 960 |
| Result | 1,200 |   | (240) | (960) | 0 | 0 |
| CTA | (200) |   |   |   | 520 | 320 |


In order to avoid such adjustment, we would recommend to foresee a "Dividends paid" flow on the cash or cash equivalent account and to add a validation between this flow and the corresponding dividends flow in equity.

This feature can easily be developed in a consolidation bundle.
