### Transfers

This column may include many transfers of reserves, depending on the consolidation complexity.

We recommend to keep a single column so as to maintain a reasonable size for this report and to link another report with as many columns of single transfers as necessary.

Here is this linked report which shows two transfers.


|   | Transfer (1) | Transfer (2) | Total transfers |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ALPHA | 400 | (360) | 40 |
| BETA | (400) |   | (400) |
| GAMMA |   | 360 | 360 |
| DELTA |   |   | 0 |
| MU |   |   | 0 |
|   | 0 | 0 | 0 |


Transfer (1) concerns the elimination of the group profit made by selling lands from ALPHA to BETA with a group profit of 500.

We booked an elimination of profit for 400  = 80% \star  500 in ALPHA accounts with a counterpart in the Reserves. At the same

time, we eliminated a profit of 500 on thk Lands account of BETA, again with a counterpart in the Reserves.

By proceeding this way, ALPHA Reserves account increases by 400 and BETA Reserves account decreases by (400).

Transfer (2) concerns the disposal of  40%  shares of GAMMA to  3^{rd}  Parties. Each time there is a disposal of consolidated shares, a corresponding part of consolidated reserves of the company disappears and the counterpart is found in the "seller" company.

In our case study, the Year 1 consolidated reserves of GAMMA are (630) and a part of  360 = 630 * [40% / 70%]  disappears and is transferred on ALPHA line.
