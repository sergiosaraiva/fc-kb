## Ownership Notes:
- E has split ownership: 1% from A, 99% from B
- Multi-currency consolidation required


At a first glance, it seems obvious (for an external observer) that company A is a holding company for UK companies. But looking closer to this group's structure, company E is owned only at  1%  by company A and at  99%  by a US

company. This fact complicates a little bit the normal approach of considering companies A, D and E as a subgroup to consolidate.

Moreover, company C is owned directly by parent company P, which is also a US company. What do we do with company C?

And finally, we also see that company F, owned by a UK company, is located in Singapore. What do we do with company F?

Is CFO's question relevant, with an easy answer? No, except if this CFO wants a segmented view of the consolidated figures, giving UK on one side and all the other companies on the other side.
