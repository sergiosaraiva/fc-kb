### Staae consolidation techniaue

Here are the accounts of companies A and B, A being considered temporarily as the consolidating company.


| A |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Fin. Inv./B | 50 | Capital 200 |
| Reserves 100 |   |   |
| Result 30 |   |   |
| Other assets | 550 | Other liabilities 270 |



| B |  |
| --- | --- |
| Reserves |  |
| Result | 20 |
| Other assets | 500, Other liabilities |



| A+B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Equity value | 60 | Capital 200 Reserves 100 Result 30 Conso. Res. 10 Minority int. 0 |
| Other assets | 550 | Other liabilities 270 |


where

- Consolidated reserves = 10 = 30% * [100 + 80 + 20] - 50  
Equity value  = 60 = 30%  \* [100 + 80 +20]  
- Other assets and liabilities are those of A because of the equity method applied to B

Now we consolidate  A + B  in  P  by the equity method with a percentage of  40% .


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv.A | 100 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,400 | Other liabilities | 650 |



| P + [A + B] |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 300 |
| Equity value(A+B) | Result | 50 |
|   | Conso. Res. | 36 |
| Other assets | 1,400 | Other liabilities |
|   |   | 650 |


where

- Consolidated reserves  = {36} = {40}% {}^{ * }\left\lbrack  {{200} + {100} + {30} + {10}}\right\rbrack  - {100}  
Equity value  \((A + B) = 136 = 40%\)  [200 + 100 + 30 + 10]  
- Other assets and liabilities are those from P only because of the equity method applied to A and B
