### 2.6 Step 6: Process all necessary eliminations to get a consolidated set of information

The consolidation can be considered as an extension of each individual statutory accounting. All consolidation adjustments are in fact journal entries that cannot be booked in statutory accounts.

Once all consolidation adjustments have been booked, we still have a balance sheet, a P&L, flows, notes to the accounts, ... but some of the amounts have been adjusted.

If the consolidation adjustments require a human brain, eliminations can be processed automatically by all consolidation software. Here are the different steps.

- For each global integration company, we calculate the minority interests in the equity and reclassify the amount on the Minority interests account  
- For each equity method company, we eliminate  100%  of all assets and liabilities accounts, excepted equity which is eliminated for the percentage which doesn't belong to the group  
- For each proportional integration company, all balance sheet and P&L accounts are eliminated for  50% , which is the normal percentage used  
- For all companies we eliminate intercompany positions, which have been eventually adjusted at step 3  
- Finally, we eliminate group part of equity and financial investment in order to calculate the consolidated reserves of each company.

All these concepts will be largely explained in the next chapters.
