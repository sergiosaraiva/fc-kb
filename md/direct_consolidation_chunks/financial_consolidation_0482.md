### For Year 2

- Company A:  \({148} = {40}% {}^{ * }\left( {{300} + {170} + {10} - {110}}\right)\)  
- Company B:  \({162.4} = {58}%  * \left( {{100} + {100} + {30} + {50}}\right)\)

The status board to be built will contain the necessary number of columns, depending on the different variations we feel useful to show.

In our example, we have noticed result of the year, increase in capital, payment of dividends, shares acquisition, translation adjustment account and percentages variations.

Here is the status board for which we provide comments hereunder


|   | Year 1 | Result | Divid. | Capital increase | CTA | Fin. Inv. acquisition | Var. % | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 31 | 4 | (2) | 40 |   | (12) | 87 | 148 |
| B | 105.8 | 17.4 |   |   | 15.2 |   | 24 | 162.4 |


#### Result

Company A:4=40% \* 10  
Company B : 17.4 = 58% * 30

#### Dividends

We will suppose parent company has disposed its  30 % company A shares by keeping the rights on  90 % of the dividends. This implies  3 ^ {rd}  Parties will receive  10 % of these dividends besides the fact they have now  40 % a participation in A.

This means a dividend of (2)  \(= 10% * (20)\) . It is important to notice that we won't find a compensation of 2 in another column. We are not consolidating the  3^{rd}  Parties group and we only act a decrease of their interests.

Capital increase corresponding to  40 = 40% * 100

CTA includes two components

- First component on the opening:  3.6 = 30^{\star}  (58% - 46%)  
Second component on the Year 2 variation:  11.6 = 20^{*}58%

giving a net variation of 15.2.

Fin. invest. acausition for  12 = 30^{*}40% . This amount is written as negative in the status board because it is an asset (debit) netted on a liabilities account (Minority interests).

Var.% is the impact on variation percentage on opening amounts.

- Company A:  87 = [200 + 160 + 30 - 20 - 80]^{\star}  [40% - 10%]  
- Company B:  {24} = {\left\lbrack  {100} + {60} + {40}\right\rbrack  }^{ * }\left\lbrack  {{58}%  - {46}% }\right\rbrack

A particular attention must be brought to the equity of company A which includes the amounts of Year 1 less the dividends paid, processed separately. Financial investment must also be included in the calculation with the correct sign.

We cannot help noticing that this status board requires a huge arithmetical effort for a weak interest from an accounting or financial point of view.

Could it be sometimes a requirement from Auditors to test the capability of the consolidator and check how he is able to master his consolidation?
