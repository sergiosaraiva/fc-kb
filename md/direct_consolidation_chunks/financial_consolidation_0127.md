# Consortium structures

We consider two groups of companies A and B without any financial links between A and B, neither between subsidiaries of A with subsidiaries of B. At this point we speak about two independent groups, except the fact that the Boards of A and B consist in majority of the same physical persons. So we can conclude that groups A and B are no so independent that they are looking like.
