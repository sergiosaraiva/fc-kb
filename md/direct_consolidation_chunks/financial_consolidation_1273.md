### Answer 3.02

Let's set the selling price to  X .

The consolidated value of the  80%  shares is  3520 = 80%  [4000 + 400].

At this moment, the consolidated gain is X - 3520. But we also have to eliminate the goodwill for 300, giving a net consolidated gain of X - 3520 - 300 which must be equal to 200.

The value of  X  is 4020.
