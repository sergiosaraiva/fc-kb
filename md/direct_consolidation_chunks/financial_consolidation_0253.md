## What to do when an intercompany difference has been detected?

Considering a classical organization of intercompany matching, differences are detected by the consolidation office during the consolidation process.

In such situation, several actions can be undertaken

- Consolidation office sends back the difference to the two companies, asking them to solve or explain it within a short delay  
- With the Auditor's agreement, the consolidation department can avoid losing too much time and give the priority to the amount on the invoice side. The same amount is then reflected in the partners accounts.  
- Consolidation office may also solve the difference the best way by booking a consolidation adjustment. But we have to keep in mind that such adjustment will have to be reversed next year. This means an additional work.

When we consider the possible number of differences that may appear in a group, we again recommend to decentralize the whole intercompany matching process using today's technologies (web) with the benefit of making each company responsible for this problem.

Now, intercompany differences will be adjusted depending on the nature of the transaction. Here are some examples.
