## 3.3 Disposal of shares of a foreign company to 3rd Parties

The disposal of shares to  3^{rd}  Parties has already been analyzed in Part 2 of this book and with this present case we propose to give a clear answer to the following question: is the translation adjustments amount attached to the shares disposed booked in P&L?

Listening to the answer from experienced actors in consolidation such as consolidators, CFO's or Auditors, the answer can be sometimes yes and sometimes no!

We propose to illustrate this through a realistic case study in order to give our own conclusion with the necessary explanations.
