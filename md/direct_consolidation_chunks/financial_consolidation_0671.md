# Consolidated accounts of the subgroup


|   | P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
|   | Goodwill | 144 | Capital 3,000 |
|   | Reserves 1,000 |   |   |
|   | Result 200 |   |   |
|   | Conso. Res.(A) 204 |   |   |
|   | Conso. Res.(B) (192) |   |   |
|   | Minority int.(A) 720 |   |   |
|   | Minority int.(B) 312 |   |   |
| where | Other assets | 11,700 | Other liabilities 6,600 |


- Consolidated reserves (A) = 204 = 60% * [2000 + 500 + 100] - [1500 + (144)]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = (192) = 48% * [1000 + (300) + (100)] - 60% * 800  
Minority interests (A) = 720 = 40%  \star  [2000 + 500 + 100 + (800)]  
Minority interests (B) = 312 = 52%  *  [1000 + (300) + (100)]

As explained in Part 2, consolidated reserves of a new company entering the consolidation scope are equal to the group part in the result since that date. In the case of a subgroup, this property doesn't apply individually to each company, but on the subgroup figures.

Indeed, the total of A and B consolidated reserves is equal to  12 = 204 +  (192) which corresponds to the group part in the profit of A,  60 = 60% * 100,  added to the group part in the loss of B,  \((48) = 48% * (100)\) .
