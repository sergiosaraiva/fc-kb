## 9.3 Proportional integration companies

Considering company A consolidated with the proportional integration at  50% , only  50%  of Assets, Liabilities and P&L accounts remain in the final consolidated balance sheet.

The elimination adjustment hereunder just eliminates  50%  of all these accounts. It can be quite a large journal entry depending on the number of accounts booked.


| A - Proportional integration = 50% |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Goodwill | 400 | (200) | Capital | 2,000 | (1,000) |
| Reserves | 800 | (400) |   |   |   |
| Fin. Invest./B | 1,000 | (500) | Result | 150 | (75) |
| Translation Adjust. | 50 | (25) |   |   |   |
| Other assets | 3,600 | (1,800) | Minority Interests | 2,000 | (1,000) |
| Total | 5,000 | (2,500) | Other liabilities | 5,000 | (2,500) |
|   |  |  |  |  |  |
| Cost of sales | 5,850 | (2,925) | Sales | 5,000 | (2,500) |
| Other expenses | 150 | (75) | Other income | 1,000 | (500) |
| Result |   |   |   |   |   |
| Minority Result |   |   |   |   |   |
| Total | 6,000 | (3,000) | Total | 6,000 | (3,000) |


Of course, for such consolidation method, there are no minority interests in the balance sheet and no minority result in the P&L.

Again, we see that  50%  of the equity still remains because it belongs to the group.
