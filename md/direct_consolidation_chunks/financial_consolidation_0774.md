# Chunk 774: Consolidation = Year 2

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

| Tangible assets | 4,300 | Result | 200 |
| Conso. Res. (A+B) | 1,540 |   |   |
| Minority int. (A+B) | 4,560 |   |   |
| Other assets | 15,400 | Other liabilities | 8,700 |


where

- Consolidated reserves  \((A + B) = 1540 = 60%\)  * [10000 + 1000 + (200) + 700 + (100)] - [6000 + (200) + (500)]  
Minority interests  \((\mathrm{A} + \mathrm{B}) = 4560 = 40%\)  [10000 + 1000 + (200) + 700 + (100)]

Of course, in these accounts, the company A equity value is not in the assets any more because this company is now merged into company A+B which is consolidated by the global integration method.
