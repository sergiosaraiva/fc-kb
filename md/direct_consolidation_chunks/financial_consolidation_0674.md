This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes.

## Content

## Context:
- P's ownership of A reduced from 100% to 50%
- 50% sold to state partner on January 1st Year 2
- Disposal price: 1,300 for 50% of A shares
- A paid dividends of 200 (Year 1 result) before disposal
- Consolidation method changes:
  - A: Global integration → Proportional method (50%)
  - B: Remains equity method (40% indirect via A)
- This represents disposal of part of subgroup A+B


On January  1st  Year 2, a new law requires company P to sell  50%  of its participation in company A to some state partner. Before closing the transaction, company A pays dividends to company P equal to its Year 1 result, so 200.

Of course, the disposal of these  50%  shares of A for a price of 1300 implies the selling of part of the subgroup A+B. Consolidation method for company A becomes the proportional method whilst B remains consolidated with the equity method.

We will consolidate Year 1 and Year 2 and will justify the group equity and  3rd  Parties variation.
