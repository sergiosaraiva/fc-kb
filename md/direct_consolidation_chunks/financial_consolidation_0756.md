## Consolidation - Year 2

We present the statutory accounts of each company, including the consolidation adjustments.


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Fin. Inv./A | 1,000 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 1,300 |   |   |
| Result | 200 |   |   |
| Other assets | 6,000 | Other liabilities | 3,500 |
| A |  |  |  |
| Goodwill |   | Capital | 1,000 |
| (a) | 150 | Reserves | 800 |
| (d) | 46 |   | (a) |
|   |   |   | (b) |
|   |   |   | (c) |
|   |   |   | (d) |
| Tangible assets | 240 |   | (e) |
| (b) | 100 | Result | (100) |
| (c) | (40) |   | (e) |
| Other assets | 6,160 | Other liabilities | 4,700 |


According to our previous explanations, there are five consolidation adjustments to book.

Adjustment (a): We maintain the goodwill of 150 attached to the initial  80%  of shares. However, the counterpart is not the financial investment any more but the reserves.

Adjustment (b): We also maintain the gross value of the goodwill allocation in the same way it has been booked in company B accounts before absorption.

Adjustment (c): This allocation continues its economical life in the group (company A) with an additional depreciation.

Adjustment (d): This entry concerns the additional goodwill related to the acquisition of the  20%  of shares. The acquisition price is 200 and the corresponding equity is  \(154 = 20% * [500 + 300 + 100 + (20) + (100) + (10)]\) , giving a goodwill of  \(46 = 200 + (154)\) . This goodwill being calculated just before the absorption, we consider the Year 1 equity of company B.

Adjustment (e): As we know the statutory accounts of company B just before absorption, we are able to calculate the result of absorption, which is


| Net value of tangible assets | 270 |
| --- | ---: |
| Other assets | 1,730 |
| Other liabilities | (1,300) |
| Financial investments (80%) | (700) |
| Financial investments 20%) | (200) |
|   | (200) |


and we will suppose that loss on absorption has been booked in the P&L.

Here are the corresponding consolidated accounts


| P + A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 196 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 1,300 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 300 | Result | 200 |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 956 |   |   |
| Other assets | 12,160 | Other liabilities | 8,200 |


where

Consolidated reserves (A) = 956 = 100% \* [1000 + 800 + 150 + 100 + (30) + 46 + (200) + (100) + (10) + 200] - 1000
