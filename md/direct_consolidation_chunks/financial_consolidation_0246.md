# Chunk 246: where

## Context

This section addresses foreign currency translation. Contains formula: L = 100 CUR * 1.3 = 130  . Includes practical examples.

## Content

## where

Tangible assets (depreciations) = 200 CUR * 1.2 = 240  
- Depreciation in P&L = 100 CUR * 1.3 = 130  
- Reserves is the value of the P&L impact of Year 1 = 140  
- Translation adjustments (equity account) for a difference of 30.

Through this example, we see that as soon as a consolidation adjustment has been booked in local currency, we have to keep track of historical impacts on P&L, which are carried forward to reserves. Ignoring this mechanism leads to technical problems in the consolidation.

This example shows also the difficulty to explain the content of the translation adjustments account in the equity.
