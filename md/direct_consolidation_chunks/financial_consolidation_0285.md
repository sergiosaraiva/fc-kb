## The adjustments - Year 1

We first consider the statutory journal entry (1) booked in company A for the sale of the products to company B. The stocks of 300 are sold for a cash value of 350 generating a stocks margin of 50. Notice that the sales to B for 350 in the P&L are declared as intercompany.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 300 | Capital | 500 |
|   | (1) (300) | Reserves | 0 |
| Cash | 200 | Result | 0 |
|   | (1) 350 | (1) | 50 |
| Purchases | 300 | Sales/B | 0 |
|   |   | (1) | 350 |
| Stocks var. | (300) | Stocks var. | 0 |
| Result | 0 | (1) | (300) |
|   | (1) 50 |   |   |


In company B accounts, we see a booking (2) of stocks for 350.


| B (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 0 | Capital | 800 |
|   | (2) 350 | Reserves | 0 |
| Cash | 800 | Result | 0 |
|   | (2) (350) |   |   |
| Purchases/A | 0 | Sales/B | 0 |
|   | (2) 350 |   |   |
| Stocks var. | 0 | Stocks var. | 0 |
|   | (2) (350) |   |   |
| Result | 0 |   |   |


Notice that the Purchases account is also intercompany.

Everything is consistent except the fact that there is a group profit of 50 that has to be eliminated.

Here are the consolidation adjustments.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 0 | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 0 |
|   |   | (a) | 50 |
| Cash | 550 | Result | 50 |
|   |   | (a) | (50) |
| Purchases | 300 | Sales/B | 350 |
|   |   | (a) | (50) |
| Stocks var. | (300) | Stocks var. | (300) |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| (a) | (50) |   |   |


The 50 profit is eliminated by reducing the sales because we consider that the group value of the stocks is 300 instead of 350. Of course, at this moment, we introduce a difference between the two intercompany positions.

The other peculiarity to be indicated is the use of the reserves account. In the previous case we have used

deferred accounts which were corresponding to what we called the "Approach 2". In this section we use 'Approach 3' in order to give a complete overview.
