### There are some important questions to consider before consolidating this subgroup for the first time

Which accounts do we receive (or accept)? If A already consolidates since a number of years, it could indeed be interesting or easy to accept consolidated accounts for the subgroup A+B instead of consolidating individually these two new companies.

If we integrate  A + B  consolidated accounts, are we sure the consolidation has been made with respect to the evaluation rules issued at company P level. P consolidation could be IFRS but not  A + B , or the opposite.

Supposing the evaluation rules are the same, there is a history in  A + B . Initial goodwill, revaluation of some assets, new provisions, translation adjustments, ... all booked through consolidation adjustments. Is it normal to take over all these adjustments in group P consolidation? Not sure at all!

Moreover, we lose some transparency because the contribution in consolidated information will show A+B but not A and B individually.

By consolidating that subgroup for the first time, the goodwill or badwill will be naturally calculated on  A + B  consolidated equity.

If there is a goodwill, such a "black box" will make difficult to book an allocation of this goodwill on some assets in A which are consolidated with those of B.

A final question under this assumption is to know what could be the future of company B. If the interesting company for group P is A, company B could be disposed to  3^{rd}  Parties in a short term. Integrating consolidated A+B figures should then be avoided.

If we consolidate individual accounts, goodwill/badwill calculated separately on A and B wouldn't be correct because there is a unique transaction to acquire a subgroup and not two companies.

Whether we consolidate companies A and B on a direct basis or not, with a unique goodwill/badwill, we would recommend to split the value on A and B in case company B is disposed and not A.

A last comment concerns the possibility that company P acquires shares of company B, taking a direct participation. This would not be advisable, but we never now. Supposing we consolidate on the A+B consolidated basis, this new group structure would become difficult to manage because we would know the value of the financial investment from P into B without knowing the exact value of the equity of B, hidden in A+B.

We will solve our case study by integrating separately companies A and B.
