## Let's consider an example

Company A has been consolidated with a financial percentage of  80%  since a certain number of years. On the  1st  of July this year, parent company P, its unique shareholder, decides to sell  20%  of shares to  3rd  Parties for a price of 500. After disposal, the consolidation method remains the global integration.

Profit of A on June 30, Year 2 is 50.

At acquisition time, a goodwill of 400 has been booked in P accounts. Consolidation is done under IFRS rules and no impairments have been booked since the beginning.

In A accounts, there is one adjustment revaluating a land as allocation of part of the initial goodwill.

The scenario we will apply to this situation is

- Consolidate the group before disposal of  20%  of shares (Year 1)  
- Analyse the disposal from the consolidation point of view  
- Consolidate the group at the end of Year 2, after disposal of  20%  of shares  
- Justify the consolidated reserves of the group between Year 1 and Year 2  
- Justify minority interests between Year 1 and Year 2
