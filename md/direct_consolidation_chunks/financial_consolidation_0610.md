# Chunk 610: Direct consolidation technique

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes. Key thresholds: significant influence (20-50%) requiring equity method. Contains formula: Other assets  = {2100} = {1300} + {550} + {50}%  * {500}  . Shows detailed calculations.

# Direct consolidation technique

The group percentage of company B is  40% = 80%  and like the previous equity method case, the  3^{rd}  Parties with their  20%  in company A have also a financial interest in B for  10% = 20%

The same principle applies here by calculating an integration percentage for company B equal to group percentage  \((40%) + 3^{rd}\)  Parties percentage  \((10%)\) .

By doing this we get the following consolidated accounts


| P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 300 |
|   | Result | 50 |
|   | Conso. Res.(A) | 64 |
|   | Conso. Res.(B) | 40 |
|   | Minority int.(A) | 56 |
|   | Minority int.(B) | 20 |
| Other assets | 2,100 | 1,070 |


in which

- Consolidated reserves(A) = 64 = 80% * [200 + 100 + 30] - 200  
- Consolidated reserves(B) = 40 = 40% * [100 + 80 + 20] - 80% * 50  
Minority interests(A)  = 56 = 20%  \* [200 + 100 + 30] - 20% \* 50  
Minority interests(B) = 20 = 10% * [100 + 80 + 20]  
- Other assets  = {2100} = {1300} + {550} + {50}%  * {500}  
Other liabilities  = 1070 = 650 + 270 + 50%  300

The conclusion is similar to the one concerning company B as an equity method company. There are minority interests to calculate in the equity of B and again, we have to consider the integration percentage as  40% + 10% . If we forget these  10%  of Minority interests and, if in the same time, we apply the proportional method with  40%  instead of  50% , the consolidated balance sheet will be in balance and no "red light" will tell something is wrong.
