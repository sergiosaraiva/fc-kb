## 4.1 Internal group disposal of a company

Restructuring a group usually has the following characteristics:

- The companies are maintained in the group, excluding external acquisitions or disposals;  
- Group's shareholders of the companies are changing ;  
- The total number of shares owned in a company remains unchanged, even if that total is split into different other group companies.

Taking a "helicopter" view on such a group, we note that there are no cash transactions with  3^{rd}  Parties and the total of shares owned by the group in each individual company and their consolidation method are globally unchanged.

Such restructuring gives the impression of having no impact on the consolidated figures. Unfortunately the reality shows that it is often wrong.
