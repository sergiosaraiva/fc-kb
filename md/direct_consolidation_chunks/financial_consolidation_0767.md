# Chunk 767: Consolidation Impact:

## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation.

## Content

## Consolidation Impact:
- Change from mixed methods to single method
- Goodwill combination required
- Asset allocations must be tracked
- New consolidation percentage affects minority interests


On January 1st Year 2, these two companies decide to merge, giving the new following group structure, and just before, company B pays 300 dividends to its shareholders.

To keep further explanations clear we will consider the merged entity  A + B  as a new company distinct from  A  and  B . In real life, one of the two companies disappears and we remain with the other, even if its name might possibly change.

The new percentage of  60%  will be explained later on.

As usual, we propose

To consolidate first Year 1  
- To analyze this merge transaction  
To consolidate Year 2

and we conclude by justifying the consolidated reserves evolution in order to validate the process.
