### 2.4 Step 4: Identify all intercompany differences and ask for explanations

After this step of translation currency we advise to analyse the intercompany positions of each company with all the others in order to check if they agree or not.

Let's keep in mind that what consolidated accounts have to show is the activity of a set of companies, the group, with the outside world, as if all these companies would have been considered as a single one.

That's the reason why consolidation process requires to eliminate receivables with payables, turnover with corresponding expenses,... but, of course, that elimination will correctly work if both amounts are equal.

Experience shows that it is not very often the case for some acceptable reasons but also for some unacceptable reasons. That's why we process this step just after the currency translation in order to give some time to each company to discuss between each other and to come back to the consolidation office with an updated or explained situation.
