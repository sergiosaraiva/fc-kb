## Consolidation of Year 2

Here are the statutory accounts of the three companies for Year 2


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Investments/A | 140 | Capital | 500 |
| Investments/B | 400 | Reserves | 220 |
|   |   | Result | 80 |
| Other assets | 660 | Other liabilities | 400 |
| A |  |  |  |
| Tang. Assets | 0 | Capital | 200 |
| Reserves | 160 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Other assets | 600 | Other liabilities | 190 |



| B |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Tang. Assets | 150 | Capital | 300 |
|   |   | Reserves | 200 |
|   |   | Result | 40 |
| Other assets | 650 | Other liabilities | 260 |


which reflect the following events

- P sells  20%  of shares of company A to  3rd  Parties for a price of 70  
- P acquires  60%  of shares of company B for a price of 400. This transaction leads to a goodwill that cannot be allocated to assets.  
- A sells its tangible assets to B for a price of 150, making a group profit of 50  
- Parent company P pays dividends of 30  
- Company A pays dividends of 20. It has been agreed that P keeps the rights to receive dividends related to the  20%  of shares disposed.

These different events need he following consolidation adjustments explained hereunder.

Adjustment (a) : Disposal of 20% of shares of company A

In statutory accounts, the  90%  of shares owned by P have a value of 180. The  20%  disposed have thus a value of  40 = 180^{\star} \((20% / 90%)\) .

On the basis of a selling price of 70, the statutory gain is 30.

In consolidation, the gain or loss is the difference between the same sale price of 70 and the equity value on the  1^{st}  of January Year 2 of the  20%  disposed. Translated into a formula, it becomes

\[
(2) = 70 - 20 % * [ 200 + 160 ]
\]

The statutory gain of 30 is turning into a loss of 2 in consolidation.

We have seen in Part 2 Section 8.14 that we have to book the following adjustment


| Parent P | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 30 |   |
| Loss on disposal | 2 |   |
| Reserves |   | 32 |


in which we set to zero the statutory gain and we book an additional loss of 2.

Adjustment (b) : Goodwill on the acquisition of  60%  of shares of company B
