### The chart of accounts

The group chart of accounts is unique, even if companies are located in different countries with legal accounting requirements. They will have to adapt.

In some countries, there exists a national chart of accounts that can be used as initial information to be extended for consolidation needs. This approach will not be so easily applicable for IFRS consolidation rules because no standard exists.
