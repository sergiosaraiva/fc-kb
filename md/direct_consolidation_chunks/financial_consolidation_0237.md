By considering this column, we have to admit that a problem appears in the accounts because the profit in the P&L (630) is no longer the same as the profit in the equity (600). The correct value is the one corresponding to a translation at the average rate. That's the reason why we have to book in column (2) a consolidation adjustment transferring 30 (debit) from an account names "Translation adjustments" to the profit (credit).

Column (3), which is just the addition of columns (1) and (2) gives the correct translated accounts of that company for Year 1.

Now, one year later, we receive again the local currency accounts of that company. Let's process the translation on the basis of a closing rate 1 CUR = 2.2 EUR and an average rate 1 CUR = 2.5 EUR.

Here is what we get.


|   | (CUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Year 2 | (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) |   |
| Assets | 5,700 | 12,540 |   |   |   |   | 12,540 |
|   | 5,700 | 12,540 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 12,540 |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Capital | 3,500 | 7,700 |   |   |   | (700) | 7,000 |
| Reserves | 300 | 660 | 30 |   | (60) |   | 630 |
| Profit | 400 | 880 |   | 120 | 60 | 700 | 1,000 |
| Translation adjustments |   |   | (30) | (120) |   |   | 610 |
| Liabilities | 1,500 | 3,300 |   |   |   |   | 3,300 |
|   | 5,700 | 12,540 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 12,540 |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Income | 3,000 | 7,500 |   |   |   |   | 7,500 |
| Expenses | 2,600 | 6,500 |   |   |   |   | 6,500 |
| Profit | 400 | 1,000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,000 |


In column (1), we see the local amounts all translated at closing rate 2.2 for the balance sheet and the P&L translated at the average rate of 2.5.

In consolidation, there is an important principle to consider. When we book an adjustment impacting the result one year, we must find this adjustment impacting the reserves next year. Moreover, if a consolidation adjustment impacts the reserves one year, we must find the same amount on the same reserves account next year. That's just a normal accounting principle.
