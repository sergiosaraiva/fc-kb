We know that if a company is consolidated by the global integration method for less than  100% , i.e. with minority interests, there is a percentage of minority interests to calculate in the financial investments which are deducted from the minority interests on the liabilities side.

In our case study, company BETA in Year 2 owns a financial investment on company MU for 4000. A goodwill of 220 impacts this amount and gives finally a minority interests contribution of (756) = -20% * [4000 + (200)].
