# 6.6 Let's build a consolidated cash flow statement

In this section, we are going to build the cash flow statement of a group consisting in two companies in Year 1 and three companies in Year 2.

The main question to be asked is which method will be used to build a cash flow statement. Without the use of professional consolidation software, we

would recommend to proceed with a spreadsheet approach. It works perfectly well for a reasonable number of companies (5 to 10, not more however).
