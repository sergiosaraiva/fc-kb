(7) In Local Gaap, an investment (or disinvestment), appears in the cash flow statement for the amount of the transaction, paid or not paid. Let's take an example. A company acquires a land in December Year 1 for a price of 100 and there is an agreement to pay in two slices, 60 in January Year 2 and 40 in January Year 3. The cash flow statement will show an investment of (100). In IFRS, we have to show as an investment only what has been paid. In our example, we would show 0 in Year 1, 60 in Year 2 and 40 in Year 3.  
(8) Financial investment must show the acquisition price of consolidated companies. Usually such acquisition generates a goodwill or a badwill which must be considered as a "technical" part of the acquisition price and being difference with the equity acquired. Goodwill (or badwill) never appears in a cash flow statement, but just the acquisition price. It is the true cash out.

(9) Capital increase (or decrease) is really a difficult part to manage. In some situation a capital increase may appear with a positive sign, sometimes with a negative sign, depending on the consolidation method of the company whose capital is increased.  
(10) Dividends paid to  3^{rd}  Parties apply, in most cases, to global integration method companies paying dividends. It is a cash out. But this problem is a tricky one and we will come back to this point later on.  
(11) If profits/losses from equity method companies are non cash items, dividends paid by such companies are really cash entering the group. It must appear in the cash flow statement.

It is maybe the right time to remind that a standard cash flow statement format doesn't exist. The one presented below has been experienced in a large number of groups of variable size (number of companies). Depending on the group activity, the CFO requirements and the Auditors, this format has been adapted.

This is only a format problem. All explanations provided in this chapter remain valid, independently of the cash flow statement format.
