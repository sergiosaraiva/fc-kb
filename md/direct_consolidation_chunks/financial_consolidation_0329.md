### The adjustments

Here are companies P and A accounts, at the end of Year 1, including already the consolidation adjustments with the necessary comments


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 500 | Capital | 1,000 |
| (c) | 84 | Reserves | 300 |
|   |   | Result | 100 |
|   |   | Badwill |   |
|   |   | (c) | 84 |
| Other assets | 1,500 | Other liabilities | 600 |



| A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 280 |
|   |   | (a) | 20 |
|   |   | (b) | (70) |
|   |   | Result | 50 |
|   |   | (a) | (20) |
| Assets DT (b) 30 |  | Provision |   |
| Other assets | 1,500 | (b) | 100 |
|   |   | Other liabilities | 670 |


Adjustment (a) eliminates a profit of 20 which corresponds to a period not belonging to the group. The starting date to show any revenue from A is July  1st . This meets here again one important principle of statutory consolidation: to show the contribution of each company since the beginning of their life in the group. That profit is just transferred in the acquired equity.

The adjustment (a) impacts two accounts in the balance sheet but all income and expense accounts in P&L are in principle impacted to eliminate the first six months.

Adjustment (b) books a provision of 100 to cover future costs identified during the due diligence process. Again, this amount of 100 has an impact on the reserves and not the P&L. A deferred tax of 30 corresponding to a tax rate of  30%  is calculated for that adjustment.

Adjustment (c) books the badwill of  84 = 500 - 80%  \* [500 + 280 + 20 + (70)], supposing we are in some non IFRS rules. If IFRS rules are applied, the badwill is booked immediately into the P&L as a profit.

Let's look now at the consolidated accounts of this first year


| P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 1,000 |
|   | Reserves | 300 |
|   | Result | 100 |
|   | Conso. Reserves (A) | 24 |
|   | Minor. Interests (A) | 152 |
|   | Badwill | 84 |
| Assets DT | Provision | 100 |
| Other assets | Other liabilities | 1,270 |


where

- Consolidated Reserves = 24 = 80% * [500 + 280 + 20 + (70) + 50 + (20)] - [500 + 84]  
Minority Interests  \(= 152 = 20% * [500 + 280 + 20 + (70) + 50 + (20)]\)
