| Assets | 3,000 | Liabilities | 2,000 |

|   | Reserves | 0 |
|   | Result | 630 |

The consolidated balance sheet hereunder implies the following comments


| P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 5,000 |
|   | Reserves | 0 |
|   | Result | 0 |
|   | Conso. reserves (A) | 2,104 |
|   | Translation adjustments | (24) |
|   | Minority interests | 1,520 |
| Assets | 13,000 | Liabilities |
| Total | 13,000 | Total |


The consolidated reserves of A are  6104 = 80% * [7000 + 0 + 630] - 4000  and you can notice that the translation adjustments of (30) are not included in the formula. Indeed, we have made a special effort to "clean" the reserves with the undesirable effect of currency rates. Including that amount in the formula would make consolidated reserves unexplainable from the classical accounting point of view.

So, the rule is that consolidated reserves of a foreign company do not include the translation adjustments.

This means that the group part of the translation adjustments,  80% \(* (30) = (24)\)  remains on a separate line in the consolidated equity.

On the contrary, the calculation of minority interests will include these translation adjustments. No specific line is required and so they are  \(1520 = 20% * [7000 + 0 + 630 + (30)]\) .

These rules may be seen as exceptions, but for the rest of the process we are back to a classical global integration.
