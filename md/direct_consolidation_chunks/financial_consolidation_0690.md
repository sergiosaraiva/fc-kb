### Consolidation of companies P and A

The global integration method applies to A with a percentage of  80% , giving


|   | P | A |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 200 | Capital | 5,000 |
| Reserves | 2,800 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 6,030 | Result | 1,000 |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 2,816 |   |   |
| Trans. Adjust. | (312) |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 1,026 |   |   |
| Other assets | 13,600 | Other liabilities | 7,500 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = 2816 = 80% * [2000 + 2000 + 1000 + (200) + 800 + (80)] - [2000 + (400)]  
Minority interests (A) = 1026 = 80% * [2000 + 2000 + 1000 + (200) + 800 + (80) + (300) + (100) + 10]  
Translation adjustments  \(= (312) = 80%\)  \* [(300) + (100) + 10]

#### Analysis of the  20%  disposal of shares

We are going to consider three different points of view which will lead to the same consolidation adjustment.

#### The "straight to the point" method

In statutory accounts, parent company P makes a disposal of  \(500 = 2000 * (20% / 80%)\)  for a price of 900, booking a statutory gain of 400.

In consolidation, we are selling  20%  of the equity for the same price of 900, giving a loss of  \(900 - 20% * [2000 + 2000 + 1000 + (200) + 800 + (80)] = 900 - 1104 = (204)\) .

But why don't we take into account the translation adjustments for (390)?

This amount has never been booked in the P&L in the past, on the contrary of all the other amounts considered at historical rates which entered the Reserves through the elimination process. If not clear, let's wait for the two other methods.

For the moment, we have to consider a consolidation adjustment eliminating the statutory gain of 400 and booking an additional loss of 204.

Moreover, we also have to eliminate the part of the net goodwill attached to the  20%  of shares disposed, that is  \(50 = [400 + (200)]^{*} (20% / 80)\) , which gives the final adjustment


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 400 |   |
| Loss on disposal | 204 |   |
| Impairment | 50 |   |
| Reserves |   | 654 |


#### The "step by step" method

The principle of this method consists in considering a transaction that occurred at statutory level with amounts that have no signification at consolidation level.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fin. Invest./A | 500 |   |
| Cash |   | 900 |
| Gain on disposal | 400 |   |


So we are going to temporarily reverse that statutory sale corresponding to the  20%  of shares by the following adjustment
