### Explanation

For the Assets and Liabilities accounts, they are added up to  100% .

Equity of P remains unchanged.

However the equity of S is integrated in proportion to the financial percentage:

Capital = capital of company P  
- Reserves = reserves of company P  
Result  =  result of company P  
- Consolidated reserves (S) = 84 = 51% × [200+150+50] - 120 (investment in S owned by P)  
Minority interests (S) = 196 = 49 % x [200+150+50]

In the Profit and Loss account, the Income and the Expenses are fully integrated (it does not include a possible intercompany problem in the example above).

As regards to the result, it is divided between Group part and Minority interests part:

Minority interests result  = 24.5 = 49% * 50  
- Group result = 100 (Result of P) + 25.5 = 51%*50 = 125.5

There is a more accounting way to get the consolidated figures, as explained hereunder.
