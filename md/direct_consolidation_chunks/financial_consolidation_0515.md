# Statutory accounts of company B

The most important issue for this company is the fact that it was not consolidated in Year 1. Being acquired on the  \mathbb{I}^{St}  of January Year 2, all flows mentioned will be taken into account to build the cash flow statement, but all the opening balance sheet amounts have to be ignored. In a consolidation software, these opening amounts would be mentioned on specific flows "Entry in the consolidation scope", considering the fact the opening amounts would have been zero. These flows are considered as non cash.

| Company B |  | Year 1 | Flows | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Capital |   | 200 | 800 | 1,000 |
| Reserves | Increase | 70 | 100 |   |

| Net variation | 180 |   |   |   |
|   | Total | 1,000 | 1,000 | 2,000 |


The disposal of tangible assets has been made for a price of 300, giving a gain on disposal of 100.

As announced, there is a capital increase for 800 which is subscribed for  70%  by company P and for  30%  by the  3^{rd}  Parties. So, we keep the same financial percentage before and after the capital increase. There are no dividends paid.

Here is the corresponding statutory cash flow statement.


| Company B | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Result | 20 |
| Depreciations | 50 |
| Gain on disposals | (100) |
| Cash flow | (30) |
| Var. Receivables | (300) |
| Var. Payables | 180 |
| Working capital | (120) |
|   |   |
| Cash from operating activities | (150) |


We start with the profit of 20 and adjust it with the depreciations and gain on tangible assets disposals.

No intercompany amounts in these net variations.


| Investments |   |
