The first columns in Assets and Liabilities represent adjusted amounts and we have explained that for such company, Minority Interests were calculated as  20%  * Equity accounts less  20%  * Financial Investments accounts. This formula is then converted into the elimination adjustment shown in the second columns.

It is indeed a balanced adjustment as announced.

After booking this elimination, it is important to notice that

- The remaining Equity is  80% , corresponding to the Group part  
Same for Financial Investments

- All other Assets and Liabilities accounts are just not eliminated because, speaking about a global integration, we have to add them to parent company accounts.

On the P&L side, all accounts are to be kept in the consolidation and we just have to transfer  30 = 20%  * 150 from Group Result to the Minority Result.
