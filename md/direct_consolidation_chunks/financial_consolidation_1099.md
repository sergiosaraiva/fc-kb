# GAMMA - Statutory cash flow statement

This presentation may look unusual because GAMMA is now consolidated by the equity method and all that information is not necessary.

We will see later on that like for closing amounts, nearly all flows in the statutory cash flow statement will also be eliminated.

- The disposal of lands is supposed to have been made with  3rd  Parties and the gain is maintained as it is.  
- The disposal of tangible assets for 1000 gives no gain or loss.

Be sure to always validate the "Net cash variation" that must be equal to the cash variation in the balance sheet.
