## Key Changes:
- P's ownership in A: 80% → 90%
- A's ownership in B: 60% → 90%
- P's indirect ownership in B: 48% → 81%


Consolidated reserves of company B are

480 = 48% * [1000 + 800 + 200] - 80% * 600 for Year 1  
445.5 = 81% * [1500 + 950 + 100] - 90% * 1800 for Year 2

and the difference to justify is (34.5).

In such a complex structure situation, we recommend to calculate consolidated reserves of B just before the transaction and just after the transaction. The difference should be considered as a goodwill or a badwill.

Here are the amounts found for our example

- Consolidated reserves before transaction:  480 = 48%  * 2000 - 80%
* 600  
- Consolidated reserves after transaction:  364.5 = 81%  * 2450 - 90%
* 1800

This implies a net variation of (115.5). This amount represents a goodwill we book at company P level as an additional goodwill related to the  10%  shares acquired by company P in company A.
