## 9.4 Equity method companies

We now consider company A consolidated by the equity method with a financial percentage of  30% . Following this method, all Assets, Liabilities and

P&L accounts are not added to parent company accounts, except Equity which is kept at  30%  and possibly financial investments.


| A - Equity method - 30% |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Goodwill | 400 | (400) | Capital | 2,000 | (1,400) |
| Reserves | 800 | (560) |   |   |   |
| Fin. Invest./B | 1,000 | (700) | Result | 150 | (105) |
| Translation Adjust. | 50 | (35) |   |   |   |
| Equity Value |   | 600 | Minority Interests |   |   |
| Other assets | 3,600 | (3,600) | Other liabilities | 2,000 | (2,000) |
| Total | 5,000 | (4,100) | Total | 5,000 | (4,100) |



| Cost of sales | 5,850 | (5,850) | Sales | 5,000 | (5,000) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Other expenses | 150 | (105) | Other income | 1,000 | (1,000) |
| Result |   |   | Profit/Equity Cies |   | 45 |
| Minority Result |   |   |   |   |   |
| Total | 6,000 | (5,955) | Total | 6,000 | (5,955) |


The balance sheet elimination is again a long journal entry because all assets and liabilities accounts are eliminated. Nevertheless, we keep  30%  of the Equity and  30%  of the Financial Investments which belong to the Group. Of course, this unbalances the journal entry and everything is going back to normal when booking the Equity Value for 600.

The approach is similar for the P&L where we eliminate also all income and expense accounts except  30%  of the revenue we keep for the Group. To balance that journal entry, we book the specific account "Profit/Equity Cies"
