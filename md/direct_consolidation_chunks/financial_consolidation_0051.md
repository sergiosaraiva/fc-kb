## Special Considerations:
- De facto control possible with < 50%
- Potential voting rights considered
- Shareholder agreements may affect control
- Different thresholds in some jurisdictions


Control de facto exists when, because of the shareholding structure or agreements between shareholders, a company with less than  50%  of the voting rights may still exercise control over the subsidiary.

For example: Company A owns  40%  of a listed company B and  25%  of the capital is owned by public shareholders. We assume that they are never present at general meetings. The rest of the shares  \((35%)\)  are owned by a company C. When voting, there will only be  75%  of the capital represented. In this case, the percentage of voting rights owned by company A in company B is  53% \((40% / 75%)\) , and therefore company A will be able to appoint the majority of the directors of the subsidiary. The control presumption is refutable.
