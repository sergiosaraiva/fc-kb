### Which companies are concerned with intercompany positions?

We have seen that companies in a group can be consolidated with the global integration method, the proportional integration method or the equity method.

For the two first methods, all accounts are integrated in the consolidated financial statements at  100%  or at the proportional percentage, which means we need to have knowledge of all intercompany positions for these two kinds of companies. But for the equity method companies, we do not integrate their individual accounts.

Consequently, it makes no sense to ask the intercompany positions for equity method companies nor to ask the same information for the two first consolidation method companies when the transactions are done with equity method companies.

Let's summarise this hereunder


|   | Global integration | Proportional integration | Equity method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Global integration | Yes | Yes | No |
| Proportional integration | Yes | Yes | No |
| Equity method | No | No | No |
