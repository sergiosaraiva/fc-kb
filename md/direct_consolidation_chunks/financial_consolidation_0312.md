## Consolidation of Year 1

Here are the parent statutory company accounts and the consolidated accounts


| P (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 800 | Capital | 2,000 |
|   |   | Reserves | 1,000 |
|   |   | Result | 300 |
| Other assets | 4,200 | Other liabilities | 1,700 |



| P + A (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 2,000 |
|   | Reserves | 1,000 |
|   | Result | 300 |
|   | Conso. Reserves (A) | 808 |
|   | Minor. Interests (A) | 510 |
|   | Trans. Adj. | 432 |
| Other assets | 10,200 | Other liabilities |


where

- Consolidated Reserves (A) = 808 = 80% * [1500 + (300) + 750 + (200) + 300 + (40)] - 800  
Minority Interests (A)  = 510 = 20%  \* [1500 + (300) + 750 + (200)  \(+300 + (40) + 300 + 200 + 40]\)  
Translation Adj.  = 432 = 80%  \* [300 + 200 + 40]

As explained in chapter 6, consolidated reserves never include translation adjustments amount in order to be able to justify the evolution of reserves in an accounting way without mixing up currency effects.

We keep a specific account which shows the group part in this amount.
