# Conclusion

This example of a group of three companies looks quite simple as it needed only a few adjustments. But it clearly shows that the building of a cash flow statement can increase rapidly in complexity.

First because the process hides a lot of calculations: translation differences, percentages in flows, different consolidation methods and changes in group structure.

On top of these difficulties, the cash view can be rather difficult because the basic information is not necessarily prepared for this purpose. We start with a pure accounting set of information, mixing up cash and non cash accounts and flows.

Moreover, for certain flows, only part of them are to be considered as cash, the other part being also cash but internal to the group.

Building a cash flow statement technically and economically correct remains a difficult exercise that cannot be imagined without a professional consolidation software rich of audit trail functions to help.

Now our final consolidated cash flow statement is obtained.

Is it definitely correct? Yes and no.

No because while acquiring company B for a price of 300 as we can see, we acquired also its bank account which was 100 on the day of acquisition.

As we have the control on that company, we could consider that the amount of cash decreases the acquisition price.

In such approach, we would have a financial investment for only (200) and a net cash variation for 240 instead of 140.

Conso (2) is an acceptable presentation with the interesting consequence that the acquisition price being reduced by 100 the impact is a little bit less visible to an external observer.
