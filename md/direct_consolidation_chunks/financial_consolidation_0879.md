## 1.3 The consolidation rules

The basic principle is that the consolidation rules to apply are those of the consolidating parent company.

In most cases, the parent company being just a holding company with no other activities, this principle is becoming non significant.

It makes much more sense to align the consolidation rules to the most important group companies.

However, we highly recommend having a long term view when starting a consolidation process by answering the following questions:

- On which market is the group going to develop the most? If it for instance on the US market, maybe it could be recommended to choose US Gaap instead of Local Gaap.  
- If the financial objective of the group is to go public in a medium term, it should start immediately with IFRS  
- If the company intends to open its capital to new investors, who maybe will ask for IFRS consolidated figures, we also recommend to start with IFRS.

In any situation, the wrong decision would be to delay the process by starting first with Local Gaap and then migrating some years later to IFRS. It can ask a huge effort in the beginning because most group companies are probably not ready. But, the effort in a few years will be the same and, moreover, the volume of work will increase because of additional reporting to justify all differences between Local Gaap and IFRS figures.
