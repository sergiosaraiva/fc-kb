It represents the figures (balance) of one company belonging to the consolidation scope and it is easy to imagine there are as many spreadsheets like this one as there are companies in the group, including the parent company.

In the first column, we start with the local currency amounts.

Going through the currency conversion step, we translate the balance sheet with a closing rate (5 in our example) and the P&L with an average rate (4 in our example). We know this is not totally correct and we have to adjust the equity accounts to comply with the historical rates. These consolidation adjustments are booked in the columns "Adjustment 1, 2, ...".

More generally speaking, all consolidation adjustments as the ones seen previously are booked in these columns.
