## 4.6 The value of a company from a consolidation point of view

The objective of this section is certainly not to give a magic formula for the value of a company. There are so many different values depending on so many various elements that we would be completely out of the subject of this book. In fact, we just want to focus on two values amongst so many others.

A first and basic value of an investment in a company A corresponds to the amount booked in parent company P accounts. That amount generally represents the historical acquisition price of the shares, which usually remains unchanged through the time. When P decides to sell these shares, the gain on disposal is just the difference between the selling price and the book value.

From the consolidation point of view, the value of company A is the part of the equity owned by P in A. We speak about the 'equity value' which will apply to any company, whenever its consolidation method is. For instance, the equity value of a  80%  owned company, consolidated by the global consolidation method, is just  80%  of its equity.

That means also, supposing company A is making profits each year without paying dividends, that the equity is increasing and so does the  80%  equity value.

Let's summarize what we just said in the following formulas

Equity value of A = Financial % * Equity of A

which could be rewritten as

Equity value of A = Investment in A + Financial % * Equity of A - Investment in A

and if we put the following brackets

Equity value of A = Investment in A + [Financial % * Equity of A - Investment in A]

we can write

Equity value of A = Investment in A + Consolidated reserves of A

This formula shows very clearly that the difference between the statutory value of A in P accounts and the equity value is equal to the consolidated reserves of A. This is not surprising because in consolidation, we show a company A whose value is increasing year after year depending on its profits.

In statutory accounts of  \mathsf{P} , the value is frozen.

The important consequence of these considerations is the fact that, for instance, if the selling price of a company is 100 and the statutory book value in P is 80, the gain on disposal is 20. If we suppose the equity value of A is 120, there is a loss on disposal of 20 in consolidation. And this is normal, because between the acquisition of A and its disposal, we have shown in consolidation a company becoming more and more "rich" or valuable.

These considerations explained here will be reminded when we will consider the adjustments needed to process a disposal of a company out of the consolidation scope.
