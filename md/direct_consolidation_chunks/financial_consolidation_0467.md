### Currency translation of Year 2

Before entering calculation, notice

- There is a capital increase for 50 to be translated at a transaction rate of 12, that is  600 = 50 \times 12  
The Year 1 profit of 20 is entirely carried forward to the Reserves  
- The Year 1 translation adjustment 31 is carried forward to Year 2 consolidation. In the meantime, the impact on result for 20 is of course carried forward to the Reserves.


|   | Year 2 CUR | At closing rate | J1 | J2 | Year 2 EUR |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Capital | 150 | 2,100 | (100) | (500) | 1,500 |
| Reserves | 100 | 1,400 | (60) | (400) | 940 |
| Result | 30 | 420 |   | (30) | 390 |
| Trans, Adjust. |   |   | 160 | 930 | 1,090 |
|   | 280 | 3,920 | 0 | 0 | 3,920 |


On this basis, the capital consists in two parts: 100 to be translated at historical rate of 9 and 50 translated at 12, giving a new historical value of  1500 = 100^{*}9 + 50^{*}12 . Regarding the closing rate value of 2100, adjusted by J1 for (100), we need an additional J2 adjustment for (500).

For the Reserves, the same view applies because 100 consists in 80 at historical rate of 9 and 20 at average rate of 11, giving a correct value of 940  = 80 * 9 + 20 * 11 . The closing rate value of 1400 adjusted by J1 for (60) must be adjusted by 32 for (400).

And, finally, the profit of 30 translated at closing rate for  420 = 30 \times 14  must be adjusted for 30 to bring it to the average rate value of 390.

It is interesting to notice that the total equity value remains unchanged, at a value of the closing rate because we only book some transfers between equity accounts and the translation adjustments account belongs to equity.

The question that now arises is to explain how do we get a variation of 930 on the translation adjustments account by passing from 160 in Year 1 to 1090 in Year 2.

Let's just apply the formulas explained above.


|   | CTA/opening 14/10 | CTA/variations 14/12 | CTA/divid. | CTA/result 14/13 | Total |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Capital | 400 | 100 |   |   | 500 |
| Reserves | 400 |   |   |   | 400 |
| Result |   |   |   | 30 | 30 |
|   | 800 | 100 | 0 | 30 | 930 |


For the currency translation adjustment (CTA) on opening

Opening capital of  400 = 100^{\star}  (14 - 10)  
- Opening reserves (including Year 1 profit) of  \(400 = 100 * (14 - 10)\)
