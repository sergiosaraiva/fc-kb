## The statutory liuidation of the company

It is important to understand how the liquidation is processed from a statutory point of view.

The basic principle is that all assets are sold to  3rd  Parties or written-off through P&L if they cannot be sold. On the assets side, the company remains with cash used to reimburse all debts.

The remaining cash after all debts reimbursed are then returned to shareholders.

In company A situation, things do not happen exactly like this. We suppose all "Tangible assets" and "Other assets" are sold for an equivalent of cash amount that is 2700. This cash is used to reimburse the amount of "Other liabilities" which is 3000. The company remains with some payables of 300 that cannot be paid. This explains the Year 2 decision of the shareholders to book a provision in their accounts for their corresponding parts.

Now that the liquidation is in process, parent company P books the following journal entries


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 240 |   |
| Payables |   | 240 |


First, parent company P recognizes payables for 240, with an impact on the P&L.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Provision | 240 |   |
| Result |   | 240 |


Secondly, the provision booked in Year 1 is used to give an impact of zero in the P&L.

Finally, company P remains with payables for 240.
