# Chunk 369: Key Considerations:

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

## Key Considerations:
- Both A and B directly owned by P
- Cross-holding affects minority interests
- May require special elimination entries


In the following accounts we limit our view to those necessary to calculate the consolidated reserves of company A which is

\[
1352 = 92% * [2000 + 1000 + 100] - 1200 - 60% * 500
\]


| P, |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
|   |   | (3) |   |   |   |
| Fin. Invest./A | 1,200 | (1,200) | Capital | ... |   |
| Fin. Invest./B | ... |   |   |   |   |
| Link Account |   | 1,200 |   |   |   |



| B * Global integration - 60% |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
|   |   | (5) | (6) |   |   |   |
| Fin. Invest./A Link Account | 500 | (200) | (300) | Capital | ... |   |
|   |   | 300 |   |   |   |   |



|   |   | A" Global Integration - 92% |  |  |   |   |   |   |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|   |   | (4) | (7) |   | (1) | (2) | (4) | (7) |
| Other assets | ... | (1,200) | (300) | Capital | 2,000 | (160) | (1,840) |   |
| Reserves | 1,000 | (80) | (920) |   |   |   |   |   |
| Result | 100 | (16) | (92) |   |   |   |   |   |
| Translation Adjust. | 200 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Link Account | Conso. Reserves |   | 2,852 | (1,200) | (300) |   |   |   |
| Minority Interests |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |


Let's now analyze all the elimination adjustments.

Column (1) is the impact of the reclassification on minority interests for  8%  of company A equity, consequence for the first step of elimination related to global integration

Column (2) eliminates the group part in A equity (92%) and reclassifies the total amount on consolidated reserves. This corresponds to the first term of our previous calculation.

Column (3) in P accounts eliminates the Financial Investment on A for 1200 and transfers the amount on a link account also in P. This elimination journal entry is in balance in P (methodology!).
