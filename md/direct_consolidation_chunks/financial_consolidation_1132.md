## Cash validation

This cash flow statement shows a "Net cash variation" of  \((1460) = 4552 + (6200) + 188\) , the three main components of this report.

This amount of (1460) should also be equal to the cash variation of the cash (and cash equivalent) account in the balance sheet.

How can we check that?


| Opening amount | 7,600 |
| --- | ---: |
| Net variation | (1,460) |
| Translation adjustments | 280 |
| Entry in consolidation scope | 3,200 |
| Change in consolidation method | (800) |
| Closing amount | 8,820 |


First, we pick up the consolidated value of the Cash account, that is 7600 and 8820 respectively, in Year 1 and Year 2 balance sheets.

We then allocate the (1460) net variation coming from the consolidated cash flow statement.

The "Translation adjustments" variation for 280 is coming from the DELTA accounts with flows explanations. Fortunately, we have only one foreign company, otherwise we would need to sum up flows for all foreign companies.

The "Entry in the consolidation scope" amount is the cash of company MU at the date it enters the group.

The "Change in consolidation method" amount is the cash of GAMMA company in Year 1 consolidation which disappears because of changing from global integral consolidation method to equity method.
