## Consolidation of Year 2

For  P , we suppose the balance sheet remains unchanged.


| P |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Investments S | 4,000 | Capital 5,000 |
| Assets | 3,000 | Liabilities 2,000 |
| Total | 7,000 | Total 7,000 |


Here is the Year 2 balance sheet of company A as calculated in previous section.


| A after currency translation (80%) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 7,000 |
|   | Reserves | 630 |
|   | Result | 1,000 |
|   | Trans. Adjust. | 610 |
| Assets | Liabilities | 3,300 |
| Total | 12,540 | 12,540 |


The consolidated balance sheet account is obtained with the same remarks, as summarized hereunder


| P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 5,000 |
|   | Reserves | 0 |
|   | Result | 0 |
|   | Conso. reserves (A) | 2,904 |
|   | Translation adjustments | 488 |
|   | Minority interests | 1,848 |
| Assets | Liabilities | 5,300 |
| Total | 15,540 | 15,540 |


- Consolidated reserves of A = 2904 = 80% * [7000 + 630 + 1000] - 4000  
- Translation adjustments  = 488 = 80%  * 610  
Minority interests  = 1848 = 20^{*}  [7000 + 630 + 1000 + 610].

The final significant remark comes from the comparison of the consolidated reserves  \times  between Year 1 and Year 2, whose difference is  800 = 2904 - 2104 = 80% \times 1000 . This amount is just the group part in the Year 2 profit of A which brings us back to the basic definition: the accumulation of group profit year after year.
