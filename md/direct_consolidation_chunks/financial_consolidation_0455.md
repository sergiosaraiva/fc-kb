# Justification of consolidated reserves evolution

We propose to present the status board first and then to bring the necessary comments afterwards


|   | Conso. Reserves Year 1 | Result Year 2 | Dividends paid | Dividends received | Transfer of reserves | Transfer of reserves | Other transfers | Parent dividends | Total | Conso. Reserves Year 2 | Difference (9)-(8) |

Column (1) shows the consolidated reserves calculated for Year 1

Column (2) shows the group result of each company, taking into account adjustments and percentage calculation

Columns (3) and (4) shows the group dividends of 18 paid by A and received by P

To be clear, we opted for two columns to show the group transfers.

Column (5a) shows a transfer of reserves of  30 = 60%  * 50, related to the elimination of the group profit. To understand this transfer, let us consider the

adjustments  \((c^{*})\)  and (d) which consist in a credit of 30 in A and a debit of  60% * 50  in B.

Column (5b) shows a transfer of 32 because of the  20%  share disposal. This is also an important point to check. Each time we sell shares the corresponding part of consolidated reserves of the concerned company decreases and the same amount appears as an increase on the line of the vendor.

Let's illustrate it with figures.

Consolidated reserves of A in Year 1 (after dividends distribution) are  \(144 = 162 + (18)\) . This net amount corresponds to a participation of  90% . After the transaction, we only keep  70%  of that company. This means we are "loosing"  32 = 144^{*}  ( 20% / 90% ) on company A line but the group keeps these reserves of 32 by considering the adjustment (d).

Column (6) is just not applicable in this case study

Column (7) shows P dividends paid

Finally, we see that the Total column (8) is equal, line per line, with the consolidated reserves coming from the Year 2 consolidation.

Again, we confirm this consolidation is technically correct regarding the group equity.
