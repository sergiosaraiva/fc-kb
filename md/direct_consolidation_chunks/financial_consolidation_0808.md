### What are the basic principles of a seameded consolidation?

We identify three basic principles:

1. We suppose that each company belonging to the consolidation scope can be uniquely identified by a criterion. For instance, a company may belong to a country (our example), may be active in a unique activity, may belong to some geographical region or currency region (EUR, USD, ...), ...  
2. For each company, a net equity situation is calculated. This net equity is the difference between the normal equity and the financial investments in other companies, regardless of the criteria in which these companies are.  
3. Intercompany amounts are eliminated only between companies belonging to the same segment criteria.

If some companies belong to more than one criterion, this segment consolidation doesn't work except if we proceed to a break down of such company into two separate entities, each entity belonging entirely to a segment.

It is important to notice that the segment consolidation approach does not care about the group's structure because each holding company becomes a normal company, with regard of the fact that its financial investments are eliminated against its own equity. These companies are loosing their role of (sub)parent company.

To reconcile the segment figures with the whole consolidated figures, we can just add corresponding figures together, except for intercompany accounts, because some amounts are not eliminated anymore when intercompany positions are declared between two companies belonging to two different segments.

Segmented consolidation may be applied to balance sheet, P&L, cash flow statement and notes to the accounts.

But, in all cases, we must be careful by reading segment consolidated figures for some other reasons.

For instance, if company F (SG) is paying dividends to company A (UK), does it make sense to still eliminate the dividends which represent revenue coming from another segment?

Another disturbing example is the fact that, for instance, company A (UK) is making a group profit with company B (US), which is eliminated in the statutory consolidation. That profit shouldn't be eliminated in the segmented consolidation.

The conclusion is that producing consolidated figures is something easy, certainly with a specialized software, but a human analysis is always necessary.
