## 1.7 Human resources

Most of the time, consolidation is considered as a seasonal task for which only one person is partly dedicated. Two reasons make it a risky situation. First, the absence of that person, whatever the reason may be, generates a planning stress. Secondly, the knowledge of the group and capability to solve sometimes rather difficult group situations are concentrated only in one person's head. Moreover, the person is maybe not sufficiently trained to solve such problem on his own. This again leads to some planning stress.

The experience shows that most groups are asking for external help during the critical time of the consolidation. This approach brings expertise and additional training to internal persons and eliminates some planning risks.

For groups of a limited number of companies, the approach of having that activity completely outsourced to expert consultants should be seriously considered.
