# 3 Conclusion

Let's just have a look around in our today's world:

In so many international airports, there are trains without drivers  
- Most parts of a car are assembled together by robots and since so many years robots are painting these cars, with almost no human intervention  
- When you need cash, you go to the cash dispenser with a « plastic card » and you get your money at any time of the day, without any human contact  
- In a very short term, activities like accounting, fiscal advices and legal contracts will be produced by expert systems.

So many other examples could be listed in so many different areas.

These forty years of experience cumulated by all the actors of the consolidation have progressively led to a mature and deep knowledge of the mechanisms of that activity.

In parallel, technology on both processing and exchange of information has brought a high level of synergy that wasn't expected at the very beginning of the consolidation adventure.

The challenge in a few years will be to make the consolidation process more and more automated with less and less human interaction because not only a fast close will be considered as a "minimum".

Having consolidated information available at any time with the necessary accuracy will become a must.

Robotisation of consolidation is probably the next step, we expect it or not.
