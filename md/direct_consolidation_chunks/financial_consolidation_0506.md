# 6.5 How would finally a consolidated cash flow statement look like?

To answer this question, we propose to keep the structure of the statutory cash flow statement seen previously and to adapt it to comply with consolidation requirements.

The numbers between brackets refer to additional comments given hereunder.


| Consolidated result | (1) |
| :--- | ---: |
| Minority result |   |
| Group result |   |
| Non cash expenses (+) |   |
| Losses of equity method companies (+) | (2) |
| Depreciations/impairments of goodwill (+) | (3) |
| Deferred taxes (charges) (+) | (4) |
| Non cash income (-) |   |
| Profits of equity method companies (-) | (2) |
| Badwills booked in P&L (-) | (5) |
| Deferred taxes (income) (-) | (4) |
| Cash flow |   |
| Net variation of receivables | (6) |
| Net variations of payables | (6) |
| Working capital |   |
|   |   |
| Cash from operating activities |   |


(1) The cash flow starts with the consolidated result, that is the group result added to the minority result. Behind this, it is important to mention that for integral consolidation method companies we will deal with  100%  of the flows whatever the financial percentage is. That's the reason why we include the result of  3^{rd}  Parties.  
(2) Losses and profits generated by equity method companies are non cash items. It is just a consequence of the consolidation process.  
(3) Depending on IFRS (impairments) or Local Gaap (depreciations), goodwill will soon or later impact the P&L. It is of course a non cash item.

(4) All deferred taxes do not correspond to any payment. We can say, in a synthetic approach, they are there to show what should have been paid if the consolidation adjustment would have been booked in the legal accounting of the company.  
(5) In IFRS, badwills are considered as a profit, but no cash has been received.  
(6) For net variations of receivables and payables, it is important to keep in mind that all intercompany flows must be ignored while building the cash flow statement. More generally, this comment is of course true for any intercompany account (loans, ...).
