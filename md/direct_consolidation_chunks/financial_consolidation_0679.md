### Here are finally the consolidated accounts


|   | P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 72 | Capital | 1,500 |
| Reserves | 1,076 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 625 | Result | (84) |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 155 |   |   |
| Equity value (B) | 400 | Conso. Res.(B) | 150 |
| Other assets | 3,850 | Other liabilities | 2,150 |


where

Consolidated reserves (A) = 155 = 50% * [1000 + 500 + 500 + 100 + (100) + (50)] - [1000 + (180)]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = 150 = 20% * [1000 + 700 + 300] - 50% * 500  
Equity value  \((\mathrm{B}) = 400 = 20%\)  [1000 + 700 + 300]  
- Other assets  = {3850} = {3000} + {50}%  * {1700}  
Other liabilities  = 2150 = 1400 + 50% * 1500
