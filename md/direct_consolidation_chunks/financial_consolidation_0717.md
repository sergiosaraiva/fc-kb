Two columns are also necessary to justify the evolution from zero in Year 1 to 440 in Year 2.

Year 2 result = 16 = 40% * 40 corresponding to the equity profit for the second half-year.

(2) = 424 = 40% * [500 + 500 + 60] corresponding to the equity value of company A on July 1<sup>st</sup> Year 2.
