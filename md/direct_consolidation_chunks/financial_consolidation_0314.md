## Justification of consolidated reserves evolution

Let's check if consolidated reserves evolution can be justified in an accounting way by using the same report as for the classical dividend.


|   | Year 1 Reserves | Year 2 Result | Divid, (-) | Divid. (+) | P Approp. | Year 2 Reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Company P | 1,300 | 346 |   | 104 | (150) | 1,600 |
| Company A | 808 | 336 | (104) |   |   | 1,040 |
|   | 2,108 | 682 | (104) | 104 | (150) | 2,640 |


Column (1) contains the contribution of each company in the Year 1 consolidated reserves

Column (2) shows the same for the individual result of each company, taking into account that the profit shown is the group profit  \(336 = 80% * [480 + (60)]\)

Column (3) shows the group part of dividends paid by each company (A pays a group dividend of 104)

Column (4) shows the part of dividends received from group companies (P receive a group dividends of 104)

Column (5) shows the dividends paid by the parent company to its shareholders

Column (6) is similar to Column (1), but for Year 2

and reading the total line, we get "Opening reserves  +  group profit - parent dividend = Closing reserves".
