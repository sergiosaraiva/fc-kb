## The adjustments - Year 2

When receiving the statutory accounts of company A for Year 2, the leasing transaction does not appear and again, not only consolidation adjustments are required but we also have to take care of "historical" adjustments of Year 1.

Here are company A adjusted accounts.


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Value) | 0 | Capital | 300 |
| (a) | 100 |   |   |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | 187 |
| (b) | (20) |   |   |
| Cash | 474 | Result | (13) |
|   |   | Loan(leasing) | 0 |
|   |   |   | (a) |
|   |   |   | (b) |
| Depreciation | 0 |   |   |
| (c) | 10 |   |   |
| Services | 13 |   |   |
| (c) | (13) |   |   |
| Interests charges | 0 |   |   |
| (c) | 3 |   |   |
| Result | (13) |   |   |


Adjustment (a) is the same as the one we have booked in Year 1.

Adjustment (b) shows a depreciation of the asset for two years and the corresponding reimbursement of capital loan.

Adjustments (c) reclassifies services into depreciation and financial interest charges in the same way we booked it in Year 1. This journal entry will last for 10 years.

The important question is to know who has to book these adjustments. We recommend to practise the "push down" policy consisting of asking companies to book these adjustments themselves somewhere between their accounting system and the consolidation reporting.
