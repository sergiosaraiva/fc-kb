For company B it is a little bit more complicated. First, we have to carry forward the "historical" adjustment (b) of Year 1 because it has an impact on the Reserves with another account. But this credit on Stocks account cannot be kept because these stocks have been sold in the meantime. So, we reverse that adjustment by the journal entry (d). You can notice that we improve the

profit by 50 and this is normal because, from the group point of view, the value of these stocks was 300 and not 350.

Then, we see the adjustment (e) which is the same as the one booked in Year 1, corresponding to the elimination of the new stocks margin of 60.

We would conclude with three comments.

- First, eliminating stocks margins between companies is not an easy process. At the end of each consolidation period, it is necessary to audit the stocks of each company and to identify which part has been sold by another company of the group with the corresponding stocks margin.  
- When decision is taken to eliminate stocks margins, the impact on the group profit can be really important the first year (50 in our case study).


|   | Year 1 | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Company A | (50) | (60) |
| Company B | 0 | 50 |
|   | (50) | (10) |


- As illustrated here above, we can see that after Year 1, and for ever, if the stocks margins are relatively similar each year, the impact on the profit cannot be significant (-10 in our case study). That's why we recommend simulating figures before taking such decision.
