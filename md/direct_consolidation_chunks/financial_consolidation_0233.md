## The balance sheet accounts

A balance sheet is a picture taken at the end of the consolidation period. It seems normal to use the currency rate corresponding to that date to translate all amounts.

Obviously, the translated balance sheet is of course in balance. Nevertheless we will explain on a basis of an example that, from an accounting point of view, this translation brings some problems. We will explain why and how we need to introduce historical rates for equity and financial investments.
