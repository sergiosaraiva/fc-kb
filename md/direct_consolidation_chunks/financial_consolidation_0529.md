# Chunk 529: Consolidated flows

## Context

This section explains minority interest calculations. Contains formula: And there is a dividend of  6 = 20%  * 30 paid to the  3^{rd}  Parties, which is a decrease.

## Content

But when we include minority interests in the equity, and we have to do so, there are some new flows as

- Entry of minority interests (A) corresponding to an increase of  20%  in the equity of company A  
- Entry of minority interests (B) corresponding to new minority interests for  30%  in the equity of company B  
- And there is a dividend of  6 = 20%  * 30 paid to the  3^{rd}  Parties, which is a decrease

All these flows explain the evolution of the consolidated equity.

The first column of the following report is supposed to be our consolidated cash flow obtained by picking up some flows (cash) from the above balance sheets.

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Net cash variation | (124) | (26) | (300) | 350 | 240 | 140 |


Restricting our view to column Year 2, we find some figures equal to the ones in our previous consolidated cash flow statement, built with the statutory approach. But we need some additional adjustments to finalize the work.
