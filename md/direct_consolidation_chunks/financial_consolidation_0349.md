### Justify the evolution of the consolidated reserves

In the same way we did for the dividends, we are going to use the following report


|   | Year 1 Reserves | Year 2 Result | Divid. (-) paid | Divid. (+) | Transfer | P Approp. | Year 2 Reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Company P | 400 | 130 |   |   | 170 |   | 700 |
| Company A | 640 | 100 |   |   | (170) |   | 570 |
|   | 1,040 | 230 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,270, |


in which the first column shows the contribution of Year 1 reserves of each company and same for the last column corresponding to Year 2. These amounts are coming from Year 1 and Year 2 consolidated balance sheet.

The second column shows contribution of Year 2 result of each company. For P, it corresponds to its statutory result of 300 adjusted by the 170 gain on disposal. For A, Year 2 statutory result is 150 consisting in 50 for the first six months and so 100 for the last six months. Applying  80%  to 50 and  60%  to 100, we find indeed 100 for the full year.

There are no dividends paid but we keep these two columns.

The transfer of reserves appears because of the gain on disposal adjustment. In fact, 170 is leaving company A because of the reduction of  20%  of percentage but these reserves do not leave the group. There are now

allocated in P accounts. The adjustment of the gain on disposal shows clearly a credit on reserves in P accounts for 170.

P is not paying dividends so no "P Appropriation" column in this case study.
