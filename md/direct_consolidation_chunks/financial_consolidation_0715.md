In this report we see a profit of 64 for company A as being  80% * 60 + 40%  * 40.

The 224 amount of transfer corresponds to the reserves disposed. At the end of June Year 2, reserves of company A are  448 = 400  (consolidated reserves Year 1)  +80% * 60  (group profit first-half year). As we sell  40%  out of  80% , the amount of transfer is equal to  224 = 448^{\star}  ( 40% / 80% ).
