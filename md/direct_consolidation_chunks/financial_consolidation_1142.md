## Purpose:
Test acquisition of consolidation knowledge through progressively complex questions covering the material from Parts 1-6.


This Part 7 is dedicated to the reader wishing to test its acquisition of knowledge.

We propose three different sets of questions increasing in complexity  \((+, + +, + + +)\)  and presented as a quiz or multiple choice questions. For each question we give four different answers amongst which only one is correct.

Here are some recommendations before starting one set of questions

- You are required to solve a set of 10 questions in a maximum of

60 minutes for Quiz 1  
90 minutes for Quizz 2  
120 minutes for Quiz 3

- Be sure to have enough time to solve a set of 10 questions at once and without being disturbed  
Of course feel free to find help in this book  
- Feel also free to use a spreadsheet or a pocket calculator, but not a professional consolidation software!  
- When answering, select only one answer  
- All amounts are supposed to be in EUR (consolidation currency). If not, it is explicitly specified.  
- Currency rates are always given by 1 CUR = ... EUR  
- Negative amounts are always written between brackets as (5) for minus 5.

To evaluate your score you can have a look at the second part of this Part 7 where we give the correct answer to each question.
