### But what is the problem in consolidation with this dividend?

The group dividend of 8 received by P is booked as a financial income in Year 2 but that amount was part of the profit of A in Year 1. This means that the consolidated profits of these two years are showing the same amount and this duplication leads to an unacceptable situation.

Going back to some basic principles of consolidation, profit of A in Year 1 is an economical profit contributing to the consolidated profit and accepted as such. The duplication use appearing in Year 2 in P accounts has to be eliminated. Clearly, we have to debit the financial income of 8.

What will be the counterpart of this account?

Let's suppose company A doesn't pay that dividend which would then be transferred to its own reserves (or retained earnings). This is the answer but, from a group point of view, the counterpart account will not be company A reserves but P reserves.
