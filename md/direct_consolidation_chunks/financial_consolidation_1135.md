# CONCLUSION

Even if this case study dealt with a rather small group of five companies, the number of transactions and events happening during Year 2 makes it a sufficiently realistic case anyway.

In spite of the small size, we had the opportunity to pragmatically show how to practically organize a consolidation process which requires precision.

The probability to face unexpected mistakes is very high and the resources to find and solve these mistakes are time consuming.

This is one important reason why we have organized the process step by step in such a way that each step can be justified and with sufficient security not to break the "building".

Groups of larger size may not resist easily to such spreadsheet approach. Professional software becomes a major option for them.
