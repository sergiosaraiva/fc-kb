## The adjustments = Year 1

At the end of Year 1, companies A and B present the following statutory accounts after having booked the necessary consolidation adjustments.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |   | B (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 0 | Capital | 1,000 | Asset (Acq. Val.) | 280 | Capital | 500 |   |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | 0 | (b) | (70) | Reserves | 0 |   |
|   |   | Result | 70 | (a) | (40) |   |   |   |
|   |   | (a) | (70) | (c) | (30) |   |   |   |
| Cash | 1,070 | Def. Income/B | 70 | Cash | 220 | Result | (40) |   |
|   |   | (a) |   | Def. Expense/A | (a) |   | 40 |   |
|   |   |   |   | (b) | (c) |   | (30) |   |


Company A adjustment (a): We eliminate the group profit of 70 and transfer it to the Deferred income account, which is intercompany with company B.

Company B adjustment (a): We reverse the statutory depreciation of 40 which is calculated on an amount not acceptable from a consolidation point of view.

Company B adjustment (b): The 70 profit which is included in the acquisition value is reversed against the Deferred Expense account, which is also intercompany with A.

Company B adjustment (c): And finally, we depreciate the asset for 30.

If we look at these final adjusted accounts, we find a net value of the asset for 180 and a depreciation in the P&L for 30, just as if this transaction would not have taken place.
