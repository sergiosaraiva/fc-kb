# FAST CLOSE

For groups closing their consolidation quite late and wishing to fasten the process next year, motivations can be found in some of the following reasons

- To comply with legal requirements  
- To anticipate future and most severe regulations  
To improve a financial reputation  
To give a better image of the management  
To do better than competitors.

However, we have met so many times difficult situations just because the group management didn't anticipate the arrival of new investors in the capital, or asked to reduce drastically the consolidation delays while imposing new consolidation evaluation rules and four consolidations a year instead of only one.

And don't reply "it will not be possible" because others will do it at your place!

In the three next sections, we will give some "tips and tricks" in order to optimize the whole consolidation process and to gain not only a few days but a few weeks.

But be aware of the fact that these tips and tricks will only be efficient if the group management is willing to improve the planning.
