## How does this status board look like?

This following status board works perfectly well and is adapted

- To groups of any size (number of companies)  
- To groups of any activity  
- To groups independently of their evaluation rules (IFRS or Local Gaap) under the only condition that booking of reserves without impacting the P&L should be done on a specific account (not the consolidated reserves but revaluation reserves)

This status board justifies the group consolidated reserves, not the Minority Interests and the Translation Adjustments which require another format and content.

Let's explain its content.


|   | Conso.ReservesYear 1 | ResultYear 2 | Dividendspaid | Dividendsreceived | TransferofReserves | Othertransfers | Parentdividends | Total | Conso.ReservesYear 2 | Difference(9)-(8) |

| (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) | (5) | (6) | (7) | (8) | (9) | (10) |   |
| Parent company |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Company 1 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Company 2 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| ... |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Company N |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Total |   |   | X | (X) | 0 |   |   |   |   |   |


It looks like a matrix of 10 columns and as many lines as there are companies in the consolidation scope. We usually start with parent company on line 1.

Column (1) contains the consolidated reserves of each company as calculated in Year 1 consolidation

Column (2) contains the group part of the result of each company

Column (3) shows the group part of dividends paid by each company, parent company excluded

Column (4) shows the group part of dividends received by each company, parent company included

Column (5) contains all transfer of reserves between companies, as explained in Situation 7 of previous section

Column (6) is to be used only in case parent company transfers reserves to its capital account. Indeed, in such situation, we notice only a decrease of its reserves and not an increase of the capital because this account is not managed by this status board.

Column (7) shows the dividends paid by the parent company. These dividends are in a separate column with regard to the dividends of the other companies, for a reason that will be explained later in this section.

Column (8) is just the horizontal total of all amounts of each line

Column (9) contains the consolidated reserves of each company as calculated in Year 2 consolidation

Column (10) shows the difference between column (9) and column (8).
