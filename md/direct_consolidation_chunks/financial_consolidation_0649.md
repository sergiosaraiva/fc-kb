## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Contains formula: giving an increase of  340 = 1300 - 960. Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

As equity, we consider Year 1 closing equity which is decreased by the 400 dividends that are processed separately.

Then we calculate the same group equity after the transaction

\[
83.33% * [1320 + 40 + 600 + (400)] = 1300
\]

giving an increase of  340 = 1300 - 960

Of course, the financial investment in P on A has been increased by 360.

Let's go back to the logic of a normal company acquisition where we compare the price to acquire and the group equity, which gives a goodwill or a badwill.

In this case, we have a goodwill for 20.

Adjustment (c): Decision has been taken to fully book this goodwill on P&L, because of low materiality.

Here are now the consolidated accounts


| P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 2,000 |
|   | Reserves | 1,520 |
|   | Result | 60 |
|   | Conso. Res.(A) | (957) |
|   | Minority int.(A) | 277 |
| Other assets | 8,000 | Other liabilities |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (957) = 83.33% * [1320 + 40 + 200 + 100] - [2000 + 360 + (20)]  
Minority interests (A)  = 277 = 16.67%  \* [1320 + 40 + 200 + 100]

In such consolidation, we recommend to justify at least the evolution of both group reserves and minority interests.
