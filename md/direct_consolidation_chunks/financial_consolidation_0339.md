## The situation

A company A is consolidated since a number of years and, one day the group decides to sell the company to  3rd  Parties. Such situation leads to a certain number of remarks, amongst which

- The shareholders' company selling company A makes a gain or loss on disposal which is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the statutory value of the financial investment booked in its accounts. Usually this value corresponds to the historical acquisition value.  
- From the consolidation point of view, we have seen that company A has a value which corresponds to its net equity. This means that the gain or loss on disposal should be calculated as the difference between the selling price and the percentage owned in company A equity. That gain or loss will not be the same as the one calculated in a statutory point of view. A consolidation adjustment may be necessary.  
- Most of the time, such a disposal never happens the first day of the year. This means that the company has still to be consolidated during the months preceding the disposal. Of course, at the end of the year, the company is not in the consolidation scope any more which means there will be no impact in the consolidated balance sheet but only an impact in the P&L for the months before disposal.  
- There may be a goodwill booked on company A or a badwill (if Local Gaap) which will have to be reversed via P&L at time of disposal.  
- When speaking about selling a company, we must understand selling shares of a company. It can happen that we don't sell all the shares of a certain company but only part of them. The consequence is that after disposal of these shares, we still keep the company in the consolidation scope, but with a different financial percentage and maybe with a different consolidation method.

- A last remark will concern foreign companies for which we have accumulated translation adjustments. This is again a technical problem we will not discuss in this section. We leave it for Part 4 related to case studies.

These remarks show that the disposal of shares of a consolidated company is quite technical.
