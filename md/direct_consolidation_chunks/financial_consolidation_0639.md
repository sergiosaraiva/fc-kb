### Correction of the group part in the result of company A

Without specifying anything, most of the consolidation software knows the opening and the closing situations. That means that the A profit of 10 being done over twelve months, the corresponding group part will be calculated with the  80% , giving 8. This is not correct.

For the first six months of Year 2, A makes a loss of (10) and the group interest is (7) = 70%  *  (10) and for the last six months its group interest is  16 = 80% * 20 . So, the correct group result is  \(9 = (7) + 16\)  instead of  8 = 80% * 10 .

The complete consolidation adjustment would be the following.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves | 1 |   |
| Result |   | 1 |
| Minority result | 1 |   |
| Minority interests |   | 1 |


This adjustment must be considered as impacting each account at  100% . That's the meaning of the  \star  against the amounts in the page before.

And here are the consolidated accounts


| P + A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 13 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 350 |   |   |
| Result | 40 |   |   |
| Conso. Res.(A) | (75) |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 38 |   |   |
| Other assets | 2,060 | Other liabilities | 1,220 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (75) = 80% * [235 + 65 + (120) + 10] + (1) + 1 - [240 + (13)]  
Minority interests (A)  = 38 = 20%  \* [235 + 65 - 120 + 10] + 1 + (1)

We will conclude by justifying the consolidated reserves evolution of the group


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends | Dividends + | Dividends P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| P | 350 | 40 |   |   |   | 390 |
| A | (84) | 9 |   |   |   | (75) |
|   | 266 | 49 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 315 |


and the minority interests


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | % Var | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 24 | 1 | 13 | 38 |
|   | 24 | 1 | 13 | 38 |


This "  %  Var" says that the  {3}^{rd }  Parties make a gain of 13 in equity.
