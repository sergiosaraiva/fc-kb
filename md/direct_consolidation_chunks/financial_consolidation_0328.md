### The situation

When a new company is entering the consolidation scope after a shares acquisition, two questions need an answer

What is the equity at the date of acquisition?  
- Can the difference between the acquisition price and the percentage of equity acquired be justified by some accounts to reevaluate or deevaluate?

After booking some assets and liabilities accounts against the opening equity, there might remain a residual difference between price and adjusted equity. If this difference is negative, we call it a badwill.

Depending on Local Gaap or IFRS rules, this badwill will be booked on a specific account in the equity or booked in the P&L as a profit.

The situation of a badwill is rather rare. Most of the time, it happens for the three following reasons

- The CEO of a company dies and the family, which is not involved in the business, wishes to sell the company as soon as possible  
- The CEO of a company retires and there is a restructuring to be done with possible employees dismiss. As he doesn't want to make this job himself and support the related costs, the price of the company is of course reduced.  
- An industrial company has some environment costs which will be supported by the acquirer. This again decreases the acquisition price.

We are going to analyse the situation of parent company P acquiring  80%  of shares of company A on July  1st . At that date, the equity is 800, including a profit of 20 for the first six months of the year.

A due diligence shows that there will be some costs for an amount of 100 to be supported by the company during the next two years, starting in Year 2.
