- Column P (1) eliminates the investment on S via the Link account  
- Column S (2) eliminates all accounts that cannot be integrated in the consolidated accounts, that means all Assets, Liabilities excepted the Equity for which the group must keep its  49% , Income and Expenses. Of course, as each column represents an adjustment, it must be in balance and for the balance sheet, we book the "Equity value of S" account which is  49%  * Equity of S.  
- Column S (3) eliminates the group part in equity  
- Column S (4) processes the investment via the Link account in the same way as before.
