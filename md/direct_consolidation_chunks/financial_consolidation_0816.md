## Valuation Example:
- Statutory book value (A in P): 1,000
- Consolidated equity (A+B subgroup): 1,200
- Difference due to consolidation adjustments
- CEO may not be aware of consolidated impacts


Is it clear that by selling company A the company B is also sold? Maybe it could be worth to ask a confirmation about company B. And if company was first sold to P or C before making the disposal transaction of A?

Very often, a CEO is not fully aware of the consolidated figures and adjustments and a selling price is estimated starting from the book value of the company.

In this example, we confirm there is a goodwill on company A and a goodwill in company A on company B. Both will be eliminated with a direct impact on the P&L.

There is also a history in consolidated figures. A few years ago, company C sold to company A some tangible fixed assets and made a gain. The gain has been eliminated in company A with depreciation adjustments which are still running today. These adjustments have of course an impact on company A equity.

Without considering too many figures, let's suppose the statutory book value of company A in parent company P accounts is 1000 and the consolidated equity of the subgroup  \mathsf{A} + \mathsf{B}_r , including all consolidation adjustments and already elimination of both goodwills, is 1200.

On the basis of these figures, we would like to clarify another issue related to the words "... no impact in the P&L" as stated in the initial question.

If we sell comoanv A for 1000, we make no profit in the statutory accounts and we make a loss of  \((200) = 1000 - 1200\)  in the consolidated accounts. This means, we have to book an adjustment for (200). So we have an impact in the P&L.

If we sell comoany A for 1200, statutory accounts shows a profit of 200 but we make a profit of zero in the consolidated accounts which implies an adjustment for (200). So we have an impact in the P&L.

If we sell comoany A for 1100, statutory accounts shows a profit of 100 but we make a loss of (100) in the consolidated accounts which implies an adjustment for (200). So we have an impact in the P&L.

This short example shows there is always a P&L impact. Make sure this point is clear to the person asking the question.
