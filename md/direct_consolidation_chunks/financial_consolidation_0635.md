- Important: Profit calculation must consider percentage before AND after increase
- A still consolidated using global integration method


In Year 1, P is supposed to own 70 shares out of 100 and so consolidates A with the global integration method.

During Year 2 (not on the first day), A increases its capital by issuing new shares. All details will be given when consolidating Year 2, but let's notice now that there is a percentage increase of  10%  for P.
