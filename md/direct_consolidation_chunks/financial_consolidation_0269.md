## 8.1 Methodology

The step of consolidation adjustments is certainly the most important one for which the person in charge of the consolidation will play a critical role for various reasons.

- Consolidation adjustments require a good knowledge of all events having potentially an impact on the consolidated financial statements. By events we mean company acquisition, company disposal, merge of companies, capital increase, shares acquisition/disposal, dividends, ... These events are usually easy to identify.  
- Some other events such as disposal of assets with group profit between companies, local bookings which do not comply with group's rules of consolidation, ... also require consolidation adjustments but are sometimes rather difficult to identify.  
- Very often, some adjustments may last for long in the consolidation and it is part of the job to keep track of these adjustments through time.

For all these reasons, consolidation adjustments require method.

- A consolidation adjustment is a journal entry that a local company cannot book on its own. By journal entry, we mean accounts that are debited and accounts that are credited because behind all this, we speak about a consolidation accounting approach.  
Each adjustment is fully booked within a single company. If an event requires adjustments impacting accounts of two or more companies, the consolidation accounting approach recommend booking a fully balanced adjustment in each individual company. In such case, use of "linked accounts" will be sometimes necessary.  
- Some difficult events imply to book adjustments that will stay for a long time in the consolidation. Such events need to be documented because consolidation actors will maybe stay for less time in the consolidation department than these adjustments.  
- Same comment can be stated for Auditors who may change from time to time. A professional documentation maintained up-to-date is highly recommended to prevent these transition situations.

Within the scope of a choice of a consolidation software, an advantage will be given to those offering the possibility to classify consolidation

adjustments by journals just as in a classical accounting system. Elimination of dividends will be booked in a specific journal, same for goodwill, elimination of group profit, stocks margins, ... Such feature gives the possibility to keep the information system clear and auditable.

The following sections will provide a number of consolidation adjustments examples based on the application of this methodology.

However, it is not possible to draw up an exhaustive list of all the consolidation adjustments or the events related to them. In the next section, our objective is to propose a set of the most classical events usually met during a consolidation. These examples are generally built over at least two periods, which shows how consolidation adjustments are booked. Methodology is really the key point until the end of this chapter, much more than the technical issues behind the events we describe.
