# PART 5 ORGANIZATION OF A CONSOLIDATION AND FAST CLOSE

It is important not to forget contingencies accounts with the same presentation.

If the option consists in asking separate local accounts and adjustments to comply with group evaluation rules, it is recommended to use debit/credit adjustments. For such presentation, the adjusted amounts are consolidated.

#### Level 3

This level is dedicated to information related to partners, mainly financial investments and intercompany amounts.

For each of these accounts, a net amount in the balance sheet is split with the contribution corresponding to each partner.

We recommend that such balance sheet accounts present two components: one with a total for all corresponding subsidiaries and another one for  3^{rd}  Parties. At the end of the consolidation process, an easy validation can be done because the group component should be set to zero.

#### Level 4

This level asks the evolution of balance sheet amounts by mean of flows.

Two remarks about this point.

Generally, only non current assets and liabilities are explained with detailed flows as acquisitions, disposals, depreciations, ... while current assets and liabilities need only a net variation flow to explain the evolution.

It wouldn't be correct not to mention some special situations of transfer of amounts, entry in the consolidation scope, merge, exit from the consolidation scope for which some specific flows must be used on each and every account, non current and current.

A special care will be brought to accounts defined in level 3, with partners, because flows will first be mentioned on the net account (Group +  3rd  Parties) and then on each partner.

#### Level 5

In most of the usual bundles proposed today, this level contains some specific reports bringing additional and useful information to the consolidation team.

Here are the most important requests.
