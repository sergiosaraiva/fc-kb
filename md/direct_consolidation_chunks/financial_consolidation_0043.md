### 2.7 Step 7: Report consolidated figures to all addressees

There are different sets of reports when consolidation process is reaching the end, mainly four sets.

- First set consists in reports that are used internally by the consolidation office. These reports, quite technical, are necessary to validate the whole consistency of the consolidated set of information.  
- A second set of reports consists in providing summarized consolidated data to the management and the Board. The presentation will be much more pleasant than technical.  
- A third set of reports needs to bring answers to Auditors questions. We recommend to ask Auditors not only which content they need but also on which support: paper, spreadsheet, direct access in a "read only" mode to the consolidation software. Keep in mind that auditing a consolidation can be as complicated as producing the consolidated figures.  
- Finally, there are a number of addressees that also need a summarized information. Amongst them, there will be financial analysts, Bankers, financial newspapers for public companies, unions, important customers or suppliers, ...

We know, by developing this step by step approach, we give the feeling that the consolidation process is something quite linear by starting with step 1 and finishing with step 7. That is partly true, but when reaching the technical set of reports, we can find an important number of mistakes making mandatory to revisit the whole process in order to improve the consistency of the figures.

This is what we mentioned earlier as a "spiral effect".
