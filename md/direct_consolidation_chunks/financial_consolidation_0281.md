## The adjustments = Year 3

At the end of Year 3, the asset is disposed to  3^{rd}  Parties. The first idea would be to say that there is nothing else to do. The problem is that the disposal has been done with the statutory net value of the asset but in consolidation we consider another value. So, let's be careful and let's proceed step by step.


| A (Year 3) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 0 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | 70(a) (70) |
|   |   | Result(b) | 0 |
| Cash | 1,070 | Def. Income/B(a)(b) | 70(a) (70) |


Company A adjustment (a): This adjustment is again the same as the one booked in Year 2

Com~anvA adjustment (b): Now that the asset has left the group, we can reverse the Deferred income and book it to the P&L. We give the profit

back to A.

Com~anB adjustment (z): We first reverse the selling transaction because made with statutory amounts. So we find back in the accounts the acquisition value, the cumulated depreciations, the reverse of the cash received and the reverse of the gain on disposal


| B (Year 3) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 0 | Capital | 500 |
| (z) | 280 |   |   |
| (b) | (70) |   |   |
| (d) | (210) |   |   |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | (80) |
| (z) | (80) | (a) | 80 |
| (a) | 80 | (c) | (60) |
| (c) | (60) |   |   |
| (d) | 60 |   |   |
| Cash | 480 | Result | 60 |
| (z) | (260) | (z) | (60) |
| (d) | 260 | (d) | 110 |
| Def. Expense/A | (b) | 70 | (e) |
| (e) | (70) |   |   |


Company B adjustments (a,b,c): These adjustments are just the carried forward of Year 2 adjustments with Reserves impact

Company B adjustment (d): Then we make the sale with consolidation amounts, giving a gain of 110

Company B adjustment (e): And finally, we have to reverse to P&L the Deferred expense of 70 which is still open in the accounts

To summarize, we could just book one adjustment in A accounts and another


| Company A | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves | 70 |   |
| Result |   | 70 |


one in B accounts, as follows


| Company B | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 20 |   |
| Reserves |   | 20 |
