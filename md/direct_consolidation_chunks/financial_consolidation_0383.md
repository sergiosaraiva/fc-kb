## 1.1 Flows on each balance sheet account

One important set of information asked to each company of the consolidation scope is an explanation on how each individual assets and liabilities account is changing between two consolidation periods.

Of course, the reasons of these changes will depend on the account. Evolution of tangible assets (acquisition value) will be explained by acquisitions, disposals, ... when evolution of tangible assets (depreciations) will be explained by depreciation of the period, depreciation on disposals,

cancellations, ... Evolution of the capital account may be described with increase by cash, increase by non cash, ...

For current assets and liabilities, we can limit the request to a net variation which, most of the time, is sufficient for the disclosures. It is indeed generally not significant to ask for increase and decrease of Payables.

These reasons of changes are booked on what is called 'flows" in consolidation. They must be seen as an independent dimension with regard to the chart of accounts.

Hereunder is a more complete example of flows generally asked to each company for an account that could be tangible assets (acquisition value).


| Opening value | 2,000 |
| --- | --- |
| Acquisitions | … |
| Disposals | … |
| Transfer between accounts | … |
| Difference on opening | … |
| Translation adjustments | … |
| Entry in consolidation scope | … |
| Merge between companies | … |
| Changes in consolidation method | … |
| … | … |
| Closing value | 2,500 |


Amounts of 2000 and 2500 are supposed to come from the balance sheet and are in local currency.

- "Transfer between accounts" flow supposes that the opposite amount is found on another account.  
- "Difference on opening" flow is booked when the closing amount imported in previous consolidation was not the final one. This amount cannot be aggregated with "Acquisitions" or "Disposals" flows. From an economical point of view, it wouldn't be correct.  
- "Translation adjustments" flow is booked for foreign companies as explained in Part 2, Chapter 6 Section 4.  
- "Entry in the consolidation scope" flow is booked when a company is consolidated for the first time. Again, it wouldn't give a correct economical picture to aggregate such amount with the "Acquisitions" flow. What has been purchased are shares of that company, not individual assets and liabilities.

- "Merge between companies" flow is used when two companies belonging to the consolidation scope are merging. This flow can be seen as a transfer flow between these two companies.  
- "Changes in consolidation method" will be booked when consolidation method is different from one period to another
