### Adjustment J1

If we go back to the statutory accounts of parent company  \mathsf{P} , we see that receivables have been considered as intercompany amounts included with a total net variation of 600. In consolidation, we know these intercompany amounts are eliminated as well as the flows attached to them. This means a net variation of only 500.

The same comment can be done for the payables in company A accounts, which implies to reduce from 990 to 890 their variation. This explains the amount of 100.
