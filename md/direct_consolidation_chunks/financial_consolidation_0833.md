### Comment 3

Referring to the previous structure, we could also have a company B owned by company A at  60% .

Let's suppose company B equity is 3000 and the financial investment on B in company A accounts is 1200.

The value of company B would be  1440 = 80%  *  60%  * 3000 but this time company A would be valuated for  \((160) = 80%\)  [1000 - 1200], a negative value!

Which interpretation can we give to this situation?

Company A is becoming a sub holding. Supposing such a company invests exactly the amount of its capital, its value would be zero and it makes sense because the value of A is completely dependant of the value of B.

Our message here is that the value of a company depends on its place in the group's structure. For any company not having financial investments in other consolidated companies, we refer to comment 1. For all the others, it is necessary to aggregate their own value with the value of their participations.
