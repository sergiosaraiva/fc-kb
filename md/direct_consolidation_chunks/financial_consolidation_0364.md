## 9.6 Elimination of financial investments and equity of each company

While consolidating a group, whatever the consolidation method is, we calculate the consolidated reserves of a company as the indirect financial percentage in the equity less the indirect percentage in the value of the financial investment of each shareholder.

We are now going to explain how to book the consolidated reserves and eliminate equity and financial investments in one set of elimination adjustments.

Let's do it on the basis of the following example.

We will focus on company A that is owned by parent company P at  80%  and by company B at  20% , this company being owned by P at  60% . The indirect financial percentage in company A is  92% = 80% + 60% * 20% .
