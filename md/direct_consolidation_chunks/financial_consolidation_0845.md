## 5.7 Existence of minority interests when acquiring  100%  of a company

This case study has a connection with the previous case.

We are in Year 1 and company A is consolidated at  80%  by its parent company P. The particular situation is that company A equity is (200) corresponding to its loss of this year.

The consolidating process calculates Minority interests equal to  \((40) = 20%\)  (200). Supposing we are in some Local Gaap not accepting negative Minority interests, there will be the following consolidation adjustment


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result (Group) | 40 |   |
| Minority interests |   | 40 |


booking the 40 as a charge for the group and consequently reducing Minority interests to zero in the balance sheet.

This adjustment is to be carried forward in the future consolidations during the time company A stays in the group at  80% .

Beginning Year 2, company P acquires the remaining  20%  of company A shares for a price of 200. This transactions implies a goodwill calculation that is equal to  \(240 = 200 - 20% * (200)\) .

While doing this Year 2 consolidation, we don't calculate Minority interests any more but we still find the previous adjustment which has been carried forward as explained above. This means we show Minority interests for 40 which is not acceptable.

We propose three different ways to solve this issue.
