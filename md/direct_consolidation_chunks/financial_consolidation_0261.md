## Unmatched intercompany transactions because of different closing dates

The situation

When a group is closing, for instance, on December 31, it is supposed that all companies of the consolidation scope are closing at the same date.

Unfortunately, from a legal point of view, there is flexibility in such a way that it is accepted for some companies to report on another date, if there is less than three months difference between these two dates.

We consider the parent company P closing on December 31 and a company A producing its reporting on September 30, three months before, which is legally acceptable. Intercompany problems arise when company A sends invoices to P during October because these invoices are all booked in P accounts but not known in A accounts.

The adjustments

There is an important principle in consolidation called the "Simultaneity principle". It means that if a transaction impacts the accounts of a company A of a group and if that transaction has also an impact on another company B in the group, both impacts must be booked during the same consolidation period.

This is clearly not the situation we are just considering and consolidation adjustments are again required. By closing on December 31, the transactions considered in October must be booked in company A accounts.

The same argument applies for any payment that would be done on one side but not recorded on the other side, just as in the cut-off situation.

The advice we would suggest is to ask to all companies to close their accounts at the same date, whatever the legal closing date is.
