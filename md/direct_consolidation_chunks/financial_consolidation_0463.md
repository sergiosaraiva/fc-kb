### Year 2 : A capital increase

Let's now look how the process is performed during Year 2 with a capital increase of  K , giving  M2 = M1 + K  in foreign currency, with  M2  being the Year 2 closing value of the capital.

We suppose the capital increase happened a certain day of Year 2 with a transaction rate of  T .

What will be the historical value of the capital at end of Year 2?

The answer is quite easy: M1 * H + K * T but the consolidation process makes it a little bit more complex.

We know that we first get the capital value at end of Year 2 at closing rate C2, giving a value of M2* C2. We also know that the translation adjustment J1 is carried forward to Year 2.

If J2 represents the translation adjustment needed for Year 2, we can write the following

\[
M 2 * C 2 + J 1 + J 2 = M 1 * H + K * T
\]

\[
J 2 = M 1 * H + K * T - M 2 * C 2 - J 1
\]

and by replacing M2 by  \mathsf{M1} + \mathsf{K}  and J1 by  \(\mathsf{M1}^{\star}(\mathsf{H} - \mathsf{C1})\) , we get

\[
J 2 = M 1 * H + K * T - (M 1 + K) * C 2 - M 1 * (H - C 1)
\]

\[
J 2 = M 1 * (C 1 - C 2) + K * (T - C 2)
\]

which becomes

\[
J 2 = M 1 ^ {*} (C 2 - C 1) + K ^ {*} (C 2 - T)
\]

if we look at the booking amount on the translation adjustment account (opposite sign).

And we now see that the Year 2 translation adjustment on this capital account includes two impacts

A first one is the variation of closing rates on opening amount M1  
- A second one is the variation of closing rate with regard to the transaction rate on the variation amount of the year.
