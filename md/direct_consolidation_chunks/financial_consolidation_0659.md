# Chunk 659: Consolidated reserves evolution

## Context

This section explains minority interest calculations. Contains formula: the total dividends that

will be paid is  170 = 50 + 50 + 70  and we consider  102 = 60% * 170  to . Shows detailed calculations.

## Consolidated reserves evolution

Analyzing Year 2 with regard to Year 1, nothing special needs to be commented.


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends | Dividends | + dividends | P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- |
| P | 1,000 | 200 |   |   | (100) | 1,100 |   |
| A | (60) | 180 |   |   |   | 120 |   |
|   | 940 | 380 | 0 | 0 | (100) | 1,220 |   |


But when we do the same analysis for Year 3 with regard to Year 2, we get


|   | Year 2 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends - | Dividends + | Dividends P | Year 3 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| P | 1,100 | 186 |   | 114 | (100) | 1,300 |
| A | 120 | 90 | (114) |   |   | 108 |
|   | 1,220 | 276 | (114) | 114 | (100) | 1,408 |


showing a problem on the line corresponding to company A. An amount of 12 is not justified.

This problem appears because we consolidate with a unique percentage of  60%  but in fact there are two percentages,  20%  and  100% , depending on the shares categories.

In each consolidation, we systematically make a mistake on the group part in the result.

The reserves and result of previous year contain the future dividends that are calculated as  60%  for the group. At the end of Year 2, the total dividends that

will be paid is  170 = 50 + 50 + 70  and we consider  102 = 60% * 170  to be received by P.

The cash situation is different. The group receives  114 = 50 + 50 + 20% * 70  and the  3^{rd}  Parties receive in cash  56 = 80% * 70  instead of  68 = 40% * 170  as calculated in the consolidation process.

So, the group should receive 12 more and the  3rd  Parties 12 less and therefore the following consolidation adjustment needs to be booked in company A account.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves | 12 |   |
| Group result |   | 12 |
| 3rd Parties result | 12 |   |
| Minority interests |   | 12 |


This adjustment impacts all accounts with  100%  of the amount.

Notice also that this adjustment has no impact on consolidated reserves and on minority interests, but only on the group result and the  3^{rd}  Parties result by applying a simple transfer for the amount of 12. No other accounts in the P&L are concerned by that adjustment.

Finally, the correct consolidated reserves evolution is the following
