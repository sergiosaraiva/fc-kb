Let's suppose the capital increase occurs on the  1^{st}  of July, Year 2. For the first six months of the year, A makes a loss of 10 and for the last six months A makes a profit of 20. This explains a profit of 10 for the twelve months fiscal year.

On that date, the total equity of A is  70 = 200 - 100 - 20 - 10  represented by 100 existing shares. One existing share equals thus 0.7. The company decides to increase its capital by an amount of 100, issuing 50 new shares for the value of 0.7, so 35 and the remaining 65 is booked as a share premium. This explains the two first accounts of the A equity.

What is the financial percentae owned in A after capital increase?

Before capital increase, P owned 70 shares out of 100 shares issued and after it owns  120 = 70 + 50  shares out of  100 + 50  shares issued. This means the percentage is now  80% = 120 / 150 .

Let's look now at the consolidation adjustments.
