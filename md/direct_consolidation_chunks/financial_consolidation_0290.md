## The situation

Depending on local accounting regulations, the same leasing contract may not be booked the same way by companies of a same group.

- In some countries, the booking consists in showing the gross value of the asset and its depreciations and the remaining value of the loan. In the P&L, we find depreciations and financial interest charges. In fact, this is the expected way to book such transaction which is also compliant with the IFRS practices.  
- In some other countries, we don't see the leased asset or the loan. Only the P&L shows a single services amount including capital reimbursement and financial interests.

For those companies having such accounting practices, additional consolidation adjustments must be booked.

Let's explain how with the following example.

Company A decides to lease an asset under the following conditions:

The corresponding leased capital is 100  
- Contract duration is 10 years  
Financial lease interest is a fixed  3%  /year during the 10 years.

Here are the company A statutory accounts for Year 1 and Year 2, which are the two periods we will follow.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Value) | 0 | Capital 300 |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves 200 |
| Cash | 487 | Result (13) |
|   |   | Loan(leasing) 0 |
| Depreciation | 0 |   |
| Services | 13 |   |
| Interests charges | 0 |   |
| Result | (13) |   |



|   | A (Year 2) |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Value) | 0 | Capital 300 |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves 187 |
| Cash | 474 | Result (13) |
|   |   | Loan(leasing) 0 |
| Depreciation | 0 |   |
| Services | 13 |   |
| Interests charges | 0 |   |
| Result | (13) |   |


We can see that the only impact of the leasing transaction is a services expense of 13 in the P&L accounts, which consists in a reimbursement of capital for 10 and financial interests for 3.

This presentation is not compliant with group's rules or IFRS rules and so need some consolidation adjustments.
