# Justify the evolution of the minority interests

The principles are the same for minority interests which appear in the first column for Year 1 and last column for Year 2, both amounts coming again from the consolidated balance sheets.

Year 2 result of 50 is  40%  of the statutory result of 150, 60 reduced by the  \((d^{*})\)  adjustment above.


|   | Year 1 Minor. Int. | Year 2 Result | Divid. (-) paid | Divid. (+) | % variation | Year 2 Minor, Int. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Company A | 360 | 50 |   |   | 370 | 780 |


The amount of 370 is the consequence of what is called in consolidation a 'structure" problem or a "discontinuing process" problem. In fact, until June Year 2,  3rd  Parties have  20%  of interests in company A equity and on July  1st  they have suddenly  40% . This increase of  20%  in the equity at this date is equal to  370 = 20% \star [1000 + 600 + 200 + 50]  and it shows that  3rd  Parties have just more interests in A equity.

This column doesn't appear for the group because, of course, it looses these 370 but receives a price for that. We don't manage the same information for the  3^{rd}  Parties.
