### Consolidation - Year 1

We need this first year consolidation to be able to study the evolution of group equity and Minority interests.

Here are the statutory accounts of companies P and A


| P |  |  |  | A |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 2,000 | Capital | 2,000 |   | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 1,000 |   | Reserves | 800 |   |   |
| Result | 500 |   | Result | (200) |   |   |
| Other assets | 3,000 | Other liabilities | 1,500 | Other assets | 2,000 | Other liabilities |


and the corresponding consolidated accounts


| P + A |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 2,000 |
|   | Reserves 1,000 |
|   | Result 500 |
|   | Conso. Res.(A) (720) |
|   | Minority int.(A) 320 |
| Other assets | 5,000 |
|   | Other liabilities 1,900 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (720) = 80% * [1000 + 800 + (200)] - 2000  
Minority interests (A)  \(= 320 = 20% * [1000 + 800 + (200)]\)

so, a consolidation without any difficulties.
