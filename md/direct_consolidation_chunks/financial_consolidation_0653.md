### Description of a situation

We suppose parent company  P  is creating a new company  A  at the beginning of Year 1. Its capital is represented by two different categories of shares as shown hereunder, each share having a value of 1.


| Shareholders |  | Parent | 3rd Parties |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Ordinary shares | 1,000 | 200 | 800 |
| Privileged shares | 1,000 | 1,000 | 0 |
| Total | 2,000 | 1,200 | 800 |
| Net percentage |  | 60% | 40% |


Shares of each category have voting rights.

The specific situation is that company A will pay each year dividends equal to  5%  of the corresponding capital of 1000, so 50. If for cash reasons, company A is not able to pay these dividends at the end of a certain year, it is carried forward in a cumulative way and paid the next year.

For the analysis of our case study, we will limit our view to only equity accounts and study the consolidated reserves evolution.
