| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 400 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 800 |   |   |
| Result | 200 |   |   |

| Other assets | 3,000 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 400 |   |   |
| Result | 100 |   |   |
| Other liabilities | 2,000 |   |   |


Consolidated accounts are the following

where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = 400 = 80% * [500 + 400 + 100] - 400  
Minority interests (A)  = 200 = 20%  \* [500 + 400 + 100]
