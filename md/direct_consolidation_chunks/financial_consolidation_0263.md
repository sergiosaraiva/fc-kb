### The situation

Depending on groups and countries, holding companies having mainly financial activities instead of commercial activities may sometimes not deduct VAT on the invoices they receive. This is again a situation leading to intercompany problems.


| A |  |  |  | H |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: |
| Receivables/B | 120 | Result | 100 |   | Result | (120) |
| Payables (VAT) | 20 |   | Payables/A | 120 |   |   |
| Result | 100 | Sales/H | 100 | Purchases/A | 120 |   |
| Result | (120) |   |   |   |   |   |


Let's consider company A invoicing an amount of 120 to a holding company H. The amount of 120 includes VAT for 20 which is a payable to the VAT administration. In H accounts, the VAT is considered as an expense because it cannot be deducted. Here are the accounts of both companies, reflecting the described situation.
