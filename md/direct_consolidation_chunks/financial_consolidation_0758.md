# 4.3 Merge of two companies

When two companies, owned at  100%  by a parent company, decide to merge, this transaction has no impact on the consolidated figures because it is a non cash transaction with no interaction with the outside world. The economical activity, initially located in two companies, is centralized in a single company but still remains in the group. Of course, all historical adjustments booked in each individual company must be kept and booked in the merged entity.

Contrary to an absorption where we have explained that the statutory result of absorption had to be reversed, there is nothing to book in a merge transaction.

That's for the basic principles.

Unfortunately, some problems arise when the two companies are owned with different percentages and, possibly, with different consolidation methods.
