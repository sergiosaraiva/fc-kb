### Consolidation - Year 2

This consolidation is not as easy as the previous one.

First, we have to calculate the new financial percentage owned by company P.

Initially, P owns 800 existing shares and the dividends transaction proposes to receive 1 new share against 4 existing shares. There will be 200 new shares fully owned by P, giving a new percentage of  \(83.33% = (800 + 200) / (1000 + 200)\) .
