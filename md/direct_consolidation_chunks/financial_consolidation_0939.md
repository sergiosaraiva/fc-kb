## Dedicated system for intercompany reconciliation

Most of the software companies are offering specialized web solutions for groups to communicate their intercompany positions and to reconcile them without any intervention from the central consolidation team.

Once such software is installed, it can be used several times during the year with a marginal cost. Experience shows that this approach reduces drastically the number of intercompany differences.

By solving themselves these intercompany differences, each correspondent becomes aware of the importance of booking correctly intercompany amounts.

This topic gives us the opportunity to clarify one point: such specialized intercompany web software does not necessarily eliminate all intercompany differences but sometimes explains why there is a difference. As an example, company A sells some services to company B which booked them as R&D in the assets. The turnover in A accounts is not matched with a purchase in B accounts, but a comment is helping to book a consolidation adjustment.
