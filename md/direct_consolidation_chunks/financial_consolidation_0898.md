### The role of planning

The planning should be sent to each company within an appropriate delay in order to be sure they can identify all risks of not being able to comply with these requirements.

The most important information is the date (and time) to communicate a final consolidation bundle to the parent company.

It must be clearly explained to each entity that it becomes normal that the figures included in the bundle are not the final local accounting ones. For instance, if figures are required for consolidation as at January 31 but the company locally closes its accounts with an Annual General Meeting in April, all entries after January 31 will be booked at consolidation level in the next consolidation, probably June 30. This situation can be felt as a severe cultural shock.
