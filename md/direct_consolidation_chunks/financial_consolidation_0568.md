## Key Point:
Complete elimination of minority interests through acquisition of remaining shares



| A + B |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Goodwill | 0 | 10 | Capital | 200 | 200 |
|   |   |   | RC(B) | 0 | 0 |
| Cash | 220 | 190 | MI(B) | 20 | 0 |


- A new goodwill of 10  
Minority interests disappearing from 20 to 0

Of course, with such simple accounts, one can also observe a cash variation of (30), but this would be impossible to detect for a larger group with many transactions.

Building a cash flow statement in this situation would not be possible.

We definitely need a cash flow statement for the stage A+B showing the price paid for this  20%  shares acquisition.

Going back to our simple example, we can say that by knowing the goodwill of 10 and the minority interests variation of (20), we could "guess" the acquisition price by subtracting one by the other  \(30 = 10 - (20)\) .

If not convinced, then let's go back to some fundamentals

\[
\begin{array}{l} Additional goodwill = Price - (1 - Group%)^{\star} Equity \\ Minority interests variation = - (1 - \text {Group} %)^{*} \text {Equity} \\ \end{array}
\]

and subtracting the second from the first, we get

Additional goodwill - Minority interests variation = Price

This approach is really not recommended because it includes a high level of risk to be wrong. The only issue is to receive a cash flow statement from that stage.
