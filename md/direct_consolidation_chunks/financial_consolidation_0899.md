### The role of training

Even if a consolidation bundle relies on an accounting logic, we think necessary to explain its structure and content to group companies before using it for the first time.

To do so we would recommend a training session with all company correspondents. One excellent approach consists in explaining first the content of the consolidation bundle and in proposing afterwards a bundle already filled-in with errors to be corrected.

Such a training should be extended to some other following topics we can suggest:

Why has the group decided to consolidate?  
- What are the basic principles of a consolidation process? Most of the correspondents probably don't know how it works and behind the explanations they will understand why all the requested information is needed.  
- Explanation about the most specific evaluation rules, including an example.  
- Presentation of the next consolidation planning.

As a conclusion for each attendee, they will be convinced their local accounting system will need some updates and improvements in order to improve the consolidation reporting.

Here are some of the main issues:

- Addition in the local chart of accounts of some specific accounts needed for consolidation reporting, as

Details on financial investments  
○ Specific accounts for intercompanies through the whole balance sheet  
Dividends received from consolidated companies  
Specific gain/loss on disposals when group transactions are concerned  
\circ  Distinction between cash and non cash for all P&L accounts
