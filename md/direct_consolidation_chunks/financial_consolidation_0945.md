## Avoid stage consolidations

Stage consolidations appear when the group can be decomposed in several independent sub-groups without implying technical problems at consolidation level.

It is clear that in a group of 50 companies which can be separated into two subgroups of about the same size of 25 companies, it could be interesting at the final level to ask to consolidate the two subgroups first. The final consolidation scope would then consist in only three companies: the parent company and the head of the two subgroups.

This "push down" policy, unfortunately, presents some disadvantages

- A lack of transparency on both sub-group consolidations concerning the respect of the final group evaluation rules  
- A difficulty for any contribution view over the fifty companies in the consolidated accounts
