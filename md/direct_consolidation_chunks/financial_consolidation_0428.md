Year 1 Year 2  


| Company A | Fin. Inv./B | 600 | 600 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
|   |  |  |  |
| Company B | Capital | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 800 | 950 |   |
| Result | 200 | 100 |   |


Let's now proceed as we did before starting by considering this new situation and noticing that if the direct percentage between A and B remains unchanged, the indirect percentage in company B becomes  54% .

Consolidated reserves of company B are

-  480 = 48% * [1000 + 800 + 200] - 80% * 600  for Year 1  
-  567 = 54% * [1000 + 950 + 100] - 90% * 600  for Year 2

giving a variation of  87 = 567 - 480  which consists in the following components,

-  54 = 54%  * 100 corresponding to the group part of the result  
(24)  \(= 48% * (50)\)  corresponding to the group part of the dividend  
117 = 6% * 1950 for the same reason as explained in precious step  
(60)  = 10%  (600) because we increase by  10%  the group part in the opening value of the Year 1 Financial investment in B.

The two last components can be considered as a group price acquisition of 60 to compare to the corresponding group part of equity we receive for that price, which is 117. This looks like a badwill calculation giving a value of 57. That amount, again, cannot remain in the reserves.

The problem is just a little bit more complicated here because the company P transaction of acquiring  10%  of company A shares has probably produced a goodwill. We mean that this badwill should be netted with the goodwill.

To confirm this point of view, the best economical reason we can give is that the company P transaction is not buying shares of a company but shares of a subgroup which is A+B.

In such situation, we recommend to book that badwill in the most appropriate way in company P accounts. By doing this, the two last components are not there anymore.
