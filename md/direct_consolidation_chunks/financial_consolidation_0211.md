# Chunk 211: Consolidation Impact:

## Context

This section explains minority interest calculations. Includes practical examples. Shows detailed calculations. Discusses relationships between entities: B.

## Content

## Consolidation Impact:
- Complex calculation of indirect percentages
- Need to eliminate cross-holdings
- Affects minority interest calculations
- May require iterative consolidation approach


Applying the step by step approach, we would first consolidate  A + B  and then  \(P + (A + B)\) , giving a consolidated balance sheet in which we would still have a "Financial investment in  B " account for a certain amount.

This amount must be eliminated against  10%  of the equity of B. And this situation could become serious if, for instance, A is supposed to be a company located on another continent, A making its own consolidation, with its own adjustments.

A+B would become a kind of a black box and we would bet that the final consolidated accounts would be achieved with great difficulties and loss of time because of the additional information needed.

And for those who still believe that the stage consolidation is a helpful technique, let consider this final example.

We see that company B owns shares of company A which makes quite impossible to determine a stage in such structure.

The stage consolidation technique becomes inefficient in such structure.
