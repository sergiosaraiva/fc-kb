## Why consolidate accounts?

History shows that by the end of the 19th century companies, primarily established in the United States, were organising in groups. They were called conglomerates at the time.

It soon became apparent how difficult it was to get an economic and financial picture of these groups of companies as a single entity. This was the difficulty faced by the financial world at the time.

Many questions arose as to how to handle, interpret and even obtain information given:

The diverse activities of the companies  
- The variety of currencies used by the countries where they were located  
The level of control or absence of control over the companies  
The range of accounting rules applied to individual accounts  
- The many transactions between the companies which partially hid their actual performance outside the group.

In other words, rules soon became necessary.
