### Answer 3.04

Consolidated reserves before transaction

For company A: (400) = 80% * 2000 - 100% * 2000  
For company B: (160) = 48% * 1000 - 80% * 800

giving a total of  \((560) = (400) + (160)\)

Consolidated reserves after transaction

For company A : (240) = 48% * 2000 - 60% * 2000  
For company B: (200) = 60% * 1000 - 100% * 800

giving a total of  \((440) = (240) + (200)\)

The impact on A and B consolidated reserves is  \(120 = (440) - (560)\)
