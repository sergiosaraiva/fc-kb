## Minority interests evolution


|   | Year1 reserves | Year2 result | % var 1 | % var 2 | Year2 reserves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 1,026 | 836 | 760 | 1,026 | 3,648 |
|   | 1,026 | 836 | 760 | 1,026 | 3,648 |


The evolution of the minority interests can be justified with the three following columns.

Year 2 result  = 836 = 40%  [2200 + (110)]

%  var  \(1 = 760 = 40% * [1510 - (390)]\)  corresponding to the part of  3^{rd}  Parties in the variation of the translation adjustments which are changing from (390) in Year 1 to 1510 in Year 2

% var 2 = 1026 = 20% 5130  corresponding to the impact of the  20%  variation on the opening equity, including the translation adjustments.
