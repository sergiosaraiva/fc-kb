## Content

| Other assets |   |   |
| Gain on disposal | 200 |   |


In which we find back the statutory value of the  20%  of shares disposed for a value of 300, we reverse the cash (Other assets) received for 500 and we eliminate the gain for 200.

Book the goodwill attached to the  20%  shares disposed which consists in carrying forward a historical adjustment


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill | 100 |   |
| Fin. Invest./A |   | 100 |


Replace the statutory financial investment by the equity value of the company


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity value | 370 |   |
| Net Fin. Invest. |   | 200 |
| Consolidated reserves |   | 170 |


This booking is based on the following relation: equity value = statutory financial value + consolidated reserves, as explained at the end of Chapter 4.

In this adjustment, 370 has been calculated a few lines above, 200 is the net value of the financial investment (300 - 100) and 170 is the value of the consolidated reserves accumulated on company A since first consolidation until disposal (limited to  20% ).

This may request maybe an additional explanation.

Let's go back to the consolidated reserves of company A at the end of Year 1, which is 640 as booked in the consolidated balance sheet above. We know that this amount is equal to non-distributed profits during company A life time in the consolidation scope until end of Year 1. But we consider the situation at the end of June Year 2 and, in the meantime, we have to add a group profit of  40 = 80% * 50  to these consolidated reserves. This gives a total of 680 and corresponds to a participation of  80% . For  20%  of shares, these consolidated reserves are equal to  170 = 20% / 80% * 680 .

We then make the transaction on the basis of these figures


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Other assets | 500 |   |
| Equity value |   | 370 |
| Gain of disposal |   | 130 |


We find back our cash (Other assets) for 500, we sell a financial asset valuated to 370 and this transaction is giving a gain of 170.

And finally, the goodwill attached to the  20%  of shares disposed must be written-off


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 100 |   |
| Goodwill |   | 100 |


When we now aggregate these five adjustments, most of these accounts are just compensating and we remain with the following adjustment


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 170 |   |
| Consolidated reserves |   | 170 |
