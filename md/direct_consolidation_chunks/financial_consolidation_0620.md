- Consolidated reserves (A) are just coming from the "pre" consolidated figures of  [P + 80% A] . They are part of the consolidating entity reserves.  
- Consolidated reserves  \((\mathrm{B} + 20% \mathrm{A}) = 16.4 = 40%\)  [100 + 80 + 20 + 16] - 70  
Equity value  \((\mathsf{P} + 80% \mathsf{A}) = 86.4 = 40%\)  [100+80+20+16]

But this final consolidated balance sheet is not the same as the one produced by the direct technique!

The difference on the equity value is 26.4 higher and the minority interests are also higher for the same amount, but even if the consolidated reserves are the same with an amount of 80.4.

Which approach is wrong?

Let's consider first the Minority interests account.

The group has an indirect financial percentage of  88%  in company A which is controlled and as such, consolidated by the global integration method. This gives  12%  of minority interests. In the stage 1 approach, we have considered a global integration of A with  80% . So  8%  of company A equity are given to the  3^{rd}  Parties instead of keeping them on group side and

\[
8 % * [ 200 + 100 + 30 ] = 26.4
\]

<!-- ========== CHUNK 26: DOC0038_pages_26_251127_160235.md ========== -->

which is the explanation of the difference on that account.

A similar error appears for the equity value account because we consider indirectly  8% = 40%  \*  20%  of the company A as a contribution to that account. This is too much and the equity value should be limited to  40%  of company B net equity. It is of course the same amount.

This simple group structure, without complex crossed participation, shows how weak can be the stage technique by leading to wrong consolidated figures.
