### 1.2 The consolidation scope

The companies entering the consolidation scope depend on the comments which are discussed in the three following questions.

#### Which companies should not enter the consolidation scope?

It is legally admitted that a company presenting figures under some thresholds defined by the group management should not enter the consolidation scope.

These thresholds are generally not defined by law and each group will appreciate it, depending on the basis of its own figures.

The experience shows, however, that a threshold of  1%  or  2%  of the turnover is usually accepted as a criterion to exclude a company from the consolidation. More often, management will take into account more than one criterion, by considering also the total equity and the total balance sheet. Exclusion will then apply when two out of three criteria are satisfied.
