### Different categories of flows

Going back just for a moment to a single statutory company, as we have already seen, we have defined two kinds of flows: cash flows as acquisitions, disposals, increases in capital, ... and non cash flows as depreciations, provisions, write-off, transfers between accounts, ...

Only cash flows are to be considered in the cash flow statement.

In consolidation, we consider three categories of flows.

Cash flows reflecting real financial transactions with the outside world

A simple example would be the acquisition of a tangible asset by a company. If that company is consolidated with the global integration method, the acquisition price would appear as an investment in the cash flow statement. If that company is consolidated with the proportional method at  50% , only  50%  of the investment would appear in the cash flow statement and nothing would appear for an equity method company.

Cash flows reflectina financial transactions with other companies of the group

It could be an increase of capital in a company A, completely subscribed by the parent company P. In such situation, the cash is moving from the P bank account to the A bank account. In the individual statutory cash flow statement of P and A, we would see that financial transaction but not in the consolidated cash flow statement because it becomes a pure group transaction not made with the outside world. Same comment can be made with regard to intercompany loans.

Non cash flows as in statutory accounts

This category of flows is similar to what we have at statutory level. Depreciations, provisions, transfers, ... flows are typical examples of flows to be ignored while building a consolidated cash flow statement, in the same way we ignore them at statutory level.

On top of these flows, we also have to consider flows that would be booked in consolidation adjustments. Let's consider a classical example of a tangible asset whose depreciation is based on another value. This would imply an additional depreciation in the balance sheet with the correspondent depreciation in the P&L (same amount!). Moreover, we could possibly have a deferred tax impact. All these amounts are pure non cash items with no interference with the cash flow statement.
