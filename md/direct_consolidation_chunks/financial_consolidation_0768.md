| Other assets | 9,000 | Other liabilities | 7,700 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A)  = 400 = 30%  [2000 + 1700 + 300] - [1000 + (200)]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = 1180 = 80% * [3000 + 3000 + 1000 + (100) + 300 + (100)] - [5000 + (500)]  
Minority interests (B) = 1420 = 20% * [3000 + 3000 + 1000 + (100) + 300 + (100)]  
Equity value (A)  = 1200 = 30%  [2000 + 1700 + 300]
