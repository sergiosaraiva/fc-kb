# Chunk 708: Consolidation Impact:

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes.

## Content

## Consolidation Impact:
- **First 6 months**: Global integration at 80% with minority interests
- **Last 6 months**: Equity method at 40% with profit from equity company
- **Balance sheet**: No minority interests, equity value appears in assets
- **Group result**: 80% of H1 result + 40% of H2 result


Such a situation implies the following remarks

- At the end of Year 2, by consolidating 12 months, we will have to show the P&L of company A with all accounts (expense and income) for the first six months because during this period the group was controlling company A. On the contrary, we cannot show the accounts related to the last six months because the group lost the control.  
- As a consequence, we need a complete detailed P&L of company A corresponding to June 30, Year 2

- Consolidating the first six months by the global integration method, we will have minority interests in the result of the period  
Consolidating the last six months by the equity method, we will have a "Profit from equity company" account  
In the balance sheet, which shows a closing situation as at December 31, Year 2, we should show no Minority interests but an Equity value will appear in the consolidated assets  
- The percentage changing during the consolidation period, we will be careful when calculating the group result because it has  80%  of the first six months result and only  40%  of the last six months result.  
- And, finally, we want to inform the reader that most of the consolidation software don't handle such situations correctly because on December 31 Year 2, it will consolidate the whole year with the equity method at  40% , which is completely wrong. Manual adjustments may be required to correct the situation. We will present our case study that way in order to show how to book these adjustments.
