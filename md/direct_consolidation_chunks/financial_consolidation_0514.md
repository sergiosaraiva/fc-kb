The Year 1 profit of 50 is paid as a dividend for 30 and transferred to reserves for 20. As explained earlier, this dividend of 30 is paid for  24 = 80% * 30  to company P.

There are intercompany payables correctly reconciled with receivables in company P accounts.

Here is the corresponding statutory cash flow statement.

| Result | 40 |
| Depreciations | 50 |
| Gain on disposals | (70) |
| Cash flow | 20 |
| Var. Receivables | (500) |
| Var. Payables | 990 |
| Working capital | 490 |
|   |   |
| Cash from operating activities | 510 |


Profit is 40 and there is a depreciation flow of 50 corresponding to depreciations in the P&L for the same amount.

Net variation of payables includes intercompany amounts.


| Investments |   |
| --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | (1,000) |
| Financial invest. | 0 |
| Disinvestments |   |
| Tangible assets | 370 |
| Financial invest. | 0 |
| Cash from Inv./Disinv. | (630) |


There are acquisitions of tangible assets for 1000 and disposals for 370. These transactions are made with  3rd  Parties. Notice that this disposal gives a gain of 70 as shown in the cash flow above.


| Capital increase | 0 |
| --- | ---: |
| Dividends | (30) |
| Cash from financial activities | (30) |
|   |  |
| Net cash variation | (150) |


No capital increase but only the payment of the dividend for 30. Remember company P receives 24  = 80%  \* 30.

The net cash variation for (150) is again equal to the net cash variation found in the balance sheet.
