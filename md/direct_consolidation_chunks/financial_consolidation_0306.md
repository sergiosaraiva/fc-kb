## Justification of minority interests evolution

The same question arises for the Minority interests evolution which is summarized in another report, different from the previous one, as follows


|   | Year 1Minor. Int. | Year 2Result | Divid. (-)paid | Divid. (+) | Year 2Minor. Int. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Company A | 34 | 6 | (2) |   | 38 |


The principles are quite similar.

On each line appear companies for which there are minority interests.

Column (1) contains the contribution of each company in the Year 1 Minority interests.

Column (2) shows the minority result of each company  \((6 = 20% * 30)\)

Column (3) shows the dividends paid by A to the  3rd  Parties  \((20% \star 10)\)

Column (4) is not used for our example, but it could be used for more complex groups structures where companies own other companies, each with minority interests and each company is supposed to pay dividends.

For each individual line, the sum of all amounts of columns (1) to (4) must be equal to the Year 2 Minority interests.

We will come back later with a deeper approach about this methodology in a specific chapter.
