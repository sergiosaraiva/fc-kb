## 3.6 Algorithm to calculate indirect financial percentages in complex group structures

Mathematics and graphs theory in particular bring an interesting contribution to a difficult situation in consolidation. Indeed, whatever complex can be the structure of a group, there exists an algorithm that calculates the indirect financial percentages.

Most of consolidation software provide this function but for groups with a limited number of companies, it is also quite easy to develop that algorithm in a spreadsheet as we explain hereunder.

We will give the explanation on the basis of the following group structure.
