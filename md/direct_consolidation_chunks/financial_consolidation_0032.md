### 1.3 Consolidation: Useful information?

There is almost one century between the first ideas of consolidation and the laws. What to say about that?

On one hand, the consolidation is a technique of information and not a technique of management, even if it gives very often an original and interesting picture on its own group.

We understand from then on the lack of haste of the groups to be consolidated, especially in the situations where an effective internal management reporting exists. Nevertheless, we notice that the most important groups, with strong structure and strong organization very often preceded the legal regulations.

Smaller groups, in an expectation position, waiting the laws in order to avoid unnecessary costs, were taking some risks by being in a position not to be able to produce consolidated figures in a short delay.

On the other hand, it is necessary to recognize that the standards published both at the international and the national level have a lack of precision. Confronted to these vague recommendations, the small and medium size groups, sometimes incompetent in front of their often complex legal and economic structure are a little disorientated.

Anyway, today the consolidated financial statements are not anymore a fashion.

If more and more groups anticipate the legal requirements, it is to be able to bring more complete information than the statutory accounts of the parent company would bring.

Among the consumers of this type of information, we meet:

- The customers and the suppliers of the group who try to know better their partner  
- The Bankers who want to appreciate needs in financing but also the attached risks  
- The financial analysts who try to estimate the financial health of the group  
- The world of the financial specialists cannot ignore this technique  
The competitors who try to identify better the group  
- And finally labour unions and more particularly works councils, as informants to the company staffs.

A public composed of so many observers who, gradually, adapt their approaches to consolidated information and, with the legal organizations, creates an irreversible evolution.
