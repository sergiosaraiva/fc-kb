## Consolidation = Year 2

Again we consider the statutory accounts of the remaining two companies, including all the consolidation adjustments.


|   |  | D |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A+B(a) | 200 | Capital | 3,000 |
| Reserves | 2,000 |   |   |
| (b) | 500 | (e) | 240 |
| (f) | 160 |   |   |
| Fin. Inv./A+B(a) | 6,000 | Result | 600 |
| (200) | (e) | (240) |   |
| (b) | (500) | (f) | (160) |
| Other assets | 4,000 | Other liabilities | 4,400 |



|   | A | + B |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | 3,600 | Capital | 10,000 |
| (c)(d) | 1,000 | Reserves | 0 |
| (300) | (c)(d) | 1,000(200) |   |
|   |   | Result | 700 |
| Other assets | 11,400 | (d) | (100) |
|   |   | Other liabilities | 4,300 |


Adjustment (a): Goodwill on former company A, now booked on company A+B

Adjustment (b): Goodwill on former company B, now booked on company A+B

Adjustment (c): Revaluation of tangible assets initially booked in company A. This adjustment follows the owner of the asset, that is company A+B

Adjustment (d): Depreciation of the revaluation, two years impacting the Reserves and this year booked in the P&L

Adjustment (e): Let us remind that just before proceeding to the merge, company B pays a dividend of 300 to its shareholder. Company B receives  240 = 80%  * 300 that has to be eliminated.

Adjustment (f): This adjustment corrects the "unfair" exchange of shares in consolidation. We have seen that, based on statutory accounts, the group was owning the same equity after the merge than before.

In consolidation, because of the goodwill allocation adjustment impacting the equity for  \(800 = 1000 + (200)\) , the group percentage on that amount is  80%

before the merge and  60%  just after, giving a "loss" on group equity for  \((160) = (20%)^{*}800.\)

The best comparison we can make is to say that we sell an equity of 160 for a price of zero, which means a loss on disposal.

This adjustment is booked in the parent company.

On the opposite, another merge situation could lead to a gain in equity. For instance, supposing there is a revaluation in company A for the same amount, we would get a gain of  240 = 30% * 800  which would be considered as a badwill because we "buy" some additional equity for a price of zero. This badwill would then reduce the existing goodwills.

Here are the consolidated accounts after the merge


|   | P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 700 | Capital | 3,000 |
| Reserves | 2,400 |   |   |
