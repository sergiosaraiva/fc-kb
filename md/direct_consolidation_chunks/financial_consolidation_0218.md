# 5.2 The direct consolidation technique

This technique is used to reduce the complexity of the group structure, to the so-called simple "rake" structure, where each company is directly consolidated by the parent company based on the indirect financial percentage held by the group in the company.

With this technique, consolidation is done in one step because all companies, regardless of their position in the group structure, are consolidated at once.

The last structure considered in the previous section, with crossed participations, would be consolidated without problems.

We remind here the group structure
