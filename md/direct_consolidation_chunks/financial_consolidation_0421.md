### Situation 4 : Company A acauires new shares of company B

We now forget the capital increase and come back to company B just paying the 50 dividends.

Company A acquires  20%  of shares of company B, on the  1^{st}  of January Year 2, for a price of 700. These new shares acquired are supposed not giving rights to dividends.


| Year 1 | Year 2 | Company A | Fin. Inv./B | 600 | 1,300 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| P | P | Company B | Capital | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| 80% | 80% | Reserves | 800 | 950 |   |
| A | A | Result | 200 | 100 |   |
| 60% | 80% |   |   |   |   |
| B | B |   |   |   |   |


Consolidated reserves of company B are

480 = 48% * [1000 + 800 + 200] - 80% * 600 for Year 1  
-  272 = 64%  * [1000 + 950 + 100] - 80% * 1300 for Year 2

and the evolution to justify is now (208).

Here are the different components

-  64 = 64% * 100  corresponding to the group part of the result  
(24)  = 48%  \* (50) corresponding to the group part of the dividend  
-  312 = 16% \star  1950 just as in the step before. We instantaneously get  16%  more in the opening equity  
(560)  = 80%  (700) which is the group part in the acquisition price of B shares acquired.

The two last items must be considered as a group price of 560 to acquire an additional group part in company B equity for 312 as goodwill on the transaction. Net amount of that goodwill is 248 and we propose the following consolidation adjustment to book in company A accounts


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill | 310 |   |
| Fin. Inv./B |   | 310 |


In this adjustment, the amount of 310 must be seen as  248 / 80%  for the same reason as explained in the previous step.

Let's recalculate the consolidated reserves of company B

520 = 64% * [1000 + 950 + 100] - 80% * [1300 - 310] for Year 2

The difference with Year 1 is now  \(40 = 64 + (24)\) .
