### That means

- Flows in local currency are translated into consolidation currency, most generally at average rate of the period  
- Some flows will be intercompany because explaining intercompany accounts evolution  
- Flows may be adjusted by consolidation adjustments  
- Flows will then be processed during the eliminations in a similar way as accounts are.

Let's consider a few examples.

Example 1 : Elimination process on flows  


|   |  | Eliminations if |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Tangible assets (Acq.Val.) | Statutory | Global 80% | Proportional 50% | Equity 30% |
| Year 1 | 1,000 |   | (500) | (1,000) |
| Acquisitions | 300 |   | (150) | (300) |
| Disposals | (100) |   | 50 | 100 |
| Transfer | 200 |   | (100) | (200) |
| Year 2 | 1,400 |   | (700) | (1,400) |


This example shows the elimination process on flows depending on the consolidation method.

For the global integration, we know that we keep  100%  of all balance sheet accounts and we do so for the flows.

For a proportional integration  \((50%)\) , we eliminate  50%  of each flow as we do for the closing amounts.

For an equity method company, we eliminate  100%  of the flow amounts as we do for the closing amounts.

This example finally shows that the elimination process acting on closing flows is the same as the one acting on closing amounts.

Example 2: Elimination process on flows when consolidation method is changing  


| Tangible assets (Acq.Val.) | Statutory | Eliminations | Consolidated |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Year 1,(Equity method 30%) | 1,000 | (1,000) | 0 |
| Acquisitions | 300 |   | 300 |
| Disposals | (100) |   | (100) |
| Transfers | 200 |   | 200 |
| Changes in conso. method |   | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Year 2 (Global 80%) | 1,400 | 0 | 1,400 |


In this example, the company is consolidated with the equity method in Year 1 and with the global integration method in Year 2, which is the consequence of shares acquisition giving the control on that company.

We first suppose the acquisition happened on the  1^{st}  of January, Year 2 which means that the whole activity of the 12 months of Year 2 must be consolidated with the global integration method. Of course, the opening amount, consolidated at end of Year 1, was eliminated by the equity method. This situation implies that the only way to justify an evolution from 0 to 1400 is to book a flow called 'Changes in conso. method" with an amount corresponding to the opening. Booking these 1000 on Acquisition flow would again not be economically correct. The group has acquired shares giving the control on that company, but it didn't' acquire these 1000 tangible assets.
