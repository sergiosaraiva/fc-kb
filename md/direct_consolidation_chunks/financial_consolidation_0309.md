### Why is this situation different from the previous one with a classical dividend?

The amount of 100 CUR was part of the economical profit of A in Year 1 consolidation and its value was 100 CUR at average rate of that period. After the annual general meeting of company A parent company P receives 80 CUR

(80% * 100 CUR) and booked at a value depending of the rate that day. We will suppose P receives from the bank an amount of 110 EUR.

There is clearly again a double impact in group profit : once in company A accounts for 80 CUR and once in parent company accounts for 110 EUR.

With this situation, we have a nice opportunity to consolidate a foreign company with the global integration method. Let's go through the process again and give all explanations at the right moment.

We are going to setup first the Year 1 consolidated accounts after currency conversion of company A accounts.

Then we will book the correct adjustment for the elimination of the dividend.

We will produce the Year 2 consolidated figures and check the equity and the minority interests in the same way we did in the previous section.
