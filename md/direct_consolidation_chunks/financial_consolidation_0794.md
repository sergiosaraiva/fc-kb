## Consolidation - Year 2

The following adjusted accounts reflect what has been explained above.


|   |  | b |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A | (a) | 500 | Capital | 2,000 |
| (b) | (500) | Reserves | 1,500 |   |
| Result | (b) (200) |   |   |   |
| (1,800) |   |   |   |   |
| Fin. Inv./A | (e) | 0 | (e) | 2,000 |
| (a) | 2,000 | (f) | 240 |   |
| (500) | (b) | (300) |   |   |
| Provision | 240 |   |   |   |
| (240) |   |   |   |   |
| Other assets | 3,700 |  | Other liabilities | 1,760 |



| A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | 1,600 | Capital | 1,000 |
| (c)(d) | 800(300) | Reserves | (800) |
|   |   | (c)(d) | 800(200) |
|   |   | Result | (500) |
|   |   | (d) | (100) |
| Other assets | 1,100 | Other liabilities | 3,000 |


Adjustment (a): Gross goodwill of 500 calculated at time of acquisition of company A after goodwill allocation on a tangible asset.

Adjustment (b): Cumulated depreciation of goodwill, consisting in 200 corresponding to Year 0 and Year 1 booked in the Reserves and 100 booked in the P&L for Year 2.

Adjustment (c): Allocation of the goodwill to tangible assets for a gross value of 800.

Adjustment (d): Depreciation of 300 corresponding to 200 for Year 0 and Year 1 booked in the Reserves and 100 booked in the P&L for Year 2.

Adjustment (e): The write-off for 2000 booked in statutory accounts has to be reversed in consolidation, while company A is consolidated.

Adjustment (f): Parent company P has booked a provision corresponding to possible payables company A will not be able to face. In fact, estimation of these payables is 300 and all shareholders agree to pay their part, that is 240 = 80% * 300 for company P. Of course, that amount of 300 is already booked in company A accounts and this leads to a double booking of the same amount, once in A and once in P as a provision. That's the reason why we reverse that amount.

Here are the consolidated accounts.


|   | P | A |   |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A | 0 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 1,300 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 2,100 | Result | 140 |
| Conso. Res.(A) | (1,340) |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 40 |   |   |
| Other assets | 4,800 | Other liabilities | 4,760 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (1340) = 80% * [1000 + (800) + 800 + (200) + (500) + (100)] - [0 + 2000 + (500)]
