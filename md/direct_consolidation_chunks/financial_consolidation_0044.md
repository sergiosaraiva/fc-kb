# 3 CONTROL AND FINANCIAL PERCENTAGES

Within the consolidation process, two percentages are used. We first need to know the control percentage owned by the group in each individual company, which is the basic information to determine the consolidation method that will be associated to each of these companies.

On the other hand, we also need to know the financial percentage owned directly and indirectly in each company of the consolidation scope, which is used to calculate group part in equity and in the profit. This financial percentage can be compared to the part of dividends that a group finally can expect to receive from these companies.
