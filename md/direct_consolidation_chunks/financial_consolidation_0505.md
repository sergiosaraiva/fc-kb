statement because they are just technical flows not related to a financial transaction. Moreover, it will be necessary to check that the total of these translation adjustments flows are the same on the assets and liabilities sides, including variation of translation adjustments account in the equity.

- A company consolidated by the equity method implies the booking of a "Result from equity method companies" in the P&L. Such account has to be considered as non cash. Supposing it is a profit, the group received no cash for this income. On the contrary, if that company is paying a dividend, it will appear in the cash flow statement because cash arrives on the bank account of the group shareholder but we don't consolidate the bank account of the equity method company.

All these examples show that the consolidation process itself makes the building of a consolidated cash flow statement even more difficult.

We could summarize all these comments by the following conceptual presentation.


|   | Year 1 | Cash variations | Non cash variations | CTA variations | Structure variations | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ASSETS |   |   |   |   |   |   |



| = | = | = | = | = | = |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year 1 | Cash variations | Non cash variations | CTA variations | Structure variations | Year 2 |
| LIABILITIES |   |   |   |   |   |


Balance sheet accounts are changing for four basic reasons

- Cash variations which will be imported in the cash flow statement  
Non cash variations as depreciations, ...  
CTA variations  
- Structure variations, including companies acquired and disposed and changes in the consolidation methods

and the difficult validation to make is that, considering initial opening and closing amounts equal between assets and liabilities, the same condition must be satisfied for each of the four categories. The total of all cash flows coming from assets accounts must be equal to the total of all cash flows coming from the liabilities. And it is the same for the three other columns. Processing this

validation brings a good assurance to build a technically correct cash flow statement.
