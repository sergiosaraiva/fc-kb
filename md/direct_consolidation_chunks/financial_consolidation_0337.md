# What will happen to the aoodwill in the future?

If the participation of  80%  remains unchanged, the goodwill will be depreciated on a linear basis.

If, for instance, company P decides to sell  20%  of its participation in the future, then the group will book  (1/4)  of the net goodwill into P&L.

If the remaining  20%  can be acquired in the future, the logic of evaluation of a possible goodwill is the same and if a new goodwill is confirmed, the second begins a four years life in the group. It is not requested to depreciate that second goodwill in order to finish its life at the same time as the first goodwill.

What happens if, buying the remaining  20% , we calculate a badwill? Booking the badwill as explained before, we would have in the consolidated accounts a goodwill corresponding to the first  80%  and simultaneously a badwill for the  20% . This situation is not acceptable. In Local Gaap, we must make a netting between both goodwill and badwill.

In IFRS, we know a badwill doesn't exist in the consolidated accounts because it is booked immediately in P&L. But, in this special situation, we also have to net both.
