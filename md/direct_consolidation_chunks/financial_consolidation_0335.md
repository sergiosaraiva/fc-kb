### The adjustments

We present hereunder companies P and A accounts, already including the consolidation adjustments.


| P |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goodwill (Gross Val.) | (d) 272 | Capital 2,000 |
| Reserves 300 |   |   |
| Goodwill (Dep.) | (e) (34) | Result 100 |
| (e) (34) |   |   |
| Fin. Invest./A | (d) 1,200 |   |
| Other assets | 1,800 | Other liabilities 600 |
| Total | 2,966 | Total 2,966 |



| A |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tang. Assets(Acq.Val.) | 1,000 | Capital | 500 |
|   | (b) | 500 | Reserves |
| Tang. Assets(Dep.) | (300) |   | (a) |
|   | (c) | (25) | (b) |
|   |   | Result | 300 |
|   |   |   | (a) |
|   |   |   | (c) |
|   |   | Liabilities DT | (15) |
|   |   |   | (b) |
|   |   |   | (c) |
| Other assets | 1,300 | Other liabilities | 1,100 |
| Total | 2,475 | Total | 2,475 |


Adjustment (a) eliminates the profit of 60 for exactly the same reason as the one we gave for the badwill situation.

Adjustment (b) revaluates the tangible asset for a gross amount of 500. A liabilities deferred tax is booked on the basis of a  40%  tax rate, so for 200, and the remaining amount of 300 is booked against the Reserves.

Adjustment (c) is the depreciation of that revaluation, corresponding to the period of the last six months of this year, so  25 = 1/2  of  10%  of 500. Of course, there is also a deferred tax impact for  10 = 40% * 25 . Net impact on P&L is only 15.

Now we have to calculate the difference between the acquisition price of 1200 and  80%  of the adjusted equity which is  928 = 80% * [500 + 300 + 60 + 300]  giving a goodwill of 272.

Adjustment (d) is the booking of the goodwill which is considered as an intangible asset.

Adjustment (e) is the depreciation of the goodwill on a basis of 4 years, so 34 =  (1/2) * [272 * 25%]  because we have to depreciate over the last six months of this first year.
