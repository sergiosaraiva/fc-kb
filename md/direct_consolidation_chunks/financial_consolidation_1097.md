# BETA - Statutory cash flow statement

Again, all statutory flows, except 'Appropriation flow", find their place in the cash flow statement.

- The investments in tangible assets for 3300 include Lands for 1500 and Tangible assets for 1800  
- The lands have been disposed by ALPHA at a price of 1500, including the gain of 500. At statutory level, we keep this price as it is but in the final consolidated cash flow statement, the amount will not appear anymore because it is a group transaction.  
- The disposal of tangible assets for an amount of 800 has been made without a gain or loss, otherwise we would see a corresponding flow  
- The increase in capital by 3000 appears on the correct line, but in the consolidated cash flow statement this amount will show only the cash brought by the  3rd  Parties. The subscription of 2400 by ALPHA will be eliminated.
