# Chunk 238: 6.2 Currency translation of a balance sheet and a P&L

## Context

This section addresses foreign currency translation.

That also means that the consolidation adjustment (1) booked in Year 1 must now appear in Year 2 with an impact on the reserves account. That is the role of column (2) to carry forward what we call "historical adjustments".

In column (3), we have the same problem as the one we had in Year 1. After translation, profit in P&L is 1.000 and profit in equity is only 880. So we need to book a debit of 120 on the "Translation adjustments account" and a credit of 120 on the profit account.

But another problem arises for the reserves account this year. Year 1 profit of 300 EUR (630 EUR) is carried forward to the reserves but we find 690 EUR instead of 630 EUR. That's the reason of the adjustment in column (4). Such an adjustment will be necessary each year from now on.

And we have a final problem with the capital because, in local currency we have no increase of capital, but after translation we find an increase of 700 EUR. This amount cannot remain on the capital account. That is the role of column (5) to debit the capital for 700 and to credit the translation adjustments for 700.

Column (6) shows the correct translated amounts.

All these adjustments pursue the same objective: find the same accounting relations on the equity after translation than the one we found in local currency.

And behind all that, we could also formulate another important consolidation principle: reserves can only evolve with the consolidated result of the group and the dividends paid by the parent company, just like (in most cases) in statutory accounts.

All other elements appearing as a variation of the reserves may not remain in that account but must be reclassified on another account, depending on its nature.
