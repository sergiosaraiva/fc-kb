### 1.1 Groups of companies

If a company is endowed with an appropriate legal and economic autonomy, it is however rare that this autonomy brings the necessary elements for its deployment.

A diversification of competence, products, a geographical expansion lead most of the time the company to look for alliances with other companies.

Practically, we notice that an alliance can range from a simple commercial representation to the take over of control of a company with the aim of influencing in a decisive way its management.

Among the alliances most classically met in our economical landscape, we shall mention, in an increasing order of dependence:

The not conventional commercial connection by which quite naturally one company C1 depends on a company C2, one being the main customer of the other one  
- The conventional commercial connection, by which a company C1 grants to a company C2 the commercial representation of its products, in order to sell them on a new market for example  
- The "physical person" connection who constitutes a subtle shape of discreet dependence between several companies, each owned, mainly most of the time, by the same physical person. These companies present between them no visible link, especially as there is absence of a holding company  
The financial connection, finally, more classic, is characterized by owning shares in the capital of another company.

As soon as one of these connections exists in a long-lasting way between two or several companies, we agree to consider the latter as being a part of the same group.

In the scope of this book, we shall consider a group of companies in the most natural way by supposing the existence of a parent company owning shares of

other companies, which are supposed to belong to the same group. All these notions will be reviewed with more details in the following chapters.
