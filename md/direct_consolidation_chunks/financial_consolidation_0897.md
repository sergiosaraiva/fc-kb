### The role of information

When a group decides to produce a first consolidation, all companies concerned should be personally informed as soon as possible in order to enable them to organize in the most efficient way.

If the first consolidated figures are to be produced at the end of Year 1, the information should be sent to companies before the end of Year 0 so as to give them the possibility to take into account all requirements in the Year 1 accounting.

Moreover, we feel important to explain to all companies the reason to consolidate. Becoming a public company, producing consolidated figures for banks in order to finance important investments are reasons that any subsidiary can understand.

It is also a good opportunity to explain to companies that some of these reasons are also to finance ... some of them. When a subsidiary needs additional financing, belonging to a group can really help. It becomes normal that the group is also asking something in return: a consolidated reporting.

From a more technical point of view, we recommend to communicate to each company the following information:

- Name and additional information of all members of the consolidation department

Name and additional information of correspondents in each group company

The list of all companies belonging to the consolidation scope, with the consolidation method. Theoretically, it makes no sense to mention intercompany amounts with equity method companies, except if the consolidation department asks for it.

- In the future, all changes in the consolidation scope (acquisitions, disposals, merges, ...) will be communicated to all companies.  
- When organizing a first consolidation, the group should analyze each individual company situation to make sure it will be able to produce the required reporting within the required delays. Keep in mind that some small companies, sometimes located quite far away from the parent company, have just no internal accounting office. This matter is maybe outsourced to a fiduciary with which there is no agreement to fill in a consolidation bundle.  
- Is the local accounting system able to answer to group requirements within the delays and with reasonable costs?  
- Local Auditors will also be informed of the group decision to consolidate because there will be some additional services not included in the current agreement.

Behind all this information, one final objective of the consolidation team is to develop a "group spirit".
