## Addition of statutory cash flow statements

The next step consists in adding line by line the five statutory cash flow statements previously built. This new cash flow statement is supposed to converge to the consolidated one.

Obviously, there are some advantages to proceed like this.

- All transactions declared at statutory level are reflected as real cash transactions and are kept unchanged in this "temporary" cash flow  
- In particular, the cash transactions on consolidated financial investments are also kept and we know that at consolidation level they are eliminated  
- Consolidation goodwills, which appear at consolidation level as intangible assets, have no place at statutory level. This is a good point because they cannot appear at consolidation level.  
- All flows related to translation adjustments have already been ignored at statutory level.

But there is quite a distance before achieving our work for some of the main following reasons

- The result on the first line is not equal to the consolidated result, because we didn't take care of the consolidation adjustments  
- Some gains/losses have been adjusted and are presently not in line with the P&L gains/losses  
Intercompany amounts have also been ignored  
- The increase in capital in GAMMA should ignore the subscription of ALPHA which is a group flow  
- Dividends paid are too high because the amount includes the payment to ALPHA, corresponding to a group transaction

And on top of these few comments, we cannot forget that we added the GAMMA cash flow statement corresponding to an equity method company!

The next pages show how we are going to take care of all these issues.
