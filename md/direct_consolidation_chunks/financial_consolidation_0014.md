## 2.2 The reconciliation of inter-company balances: is there hope?

We feel that it is necessary to address briefly an area that has historically been a weak link in the consolidation process, that is, the reconciliation of inter-company balances.

We have identified several invariable aspects of consolidation over the past forty years:

- Regardless of the size of their perimeter, a majority of groups have an abnormally high number of unreconciled inter-company transactions which are recorded at a critical time in the process, that is, too late.

- This often leads to big meetings during which, after giving out the bad grades, consolidation managers and their counterparts leave after agreeing to new and promising measures that are complied with during the next consolidation period, before old habits return.  
- Over the past four decades, the resources implemented to improve this situation have relied on setting up information flows, first using paper forms, then with spreadsheets and via email exchanges. Everyone inspects their own inter-company positions with their partners, although most of them are already correct. This is a waste of time resources.  
- With the arrival of ERP software and the resulting high degree of group centralisation, it was reasonable to expect greater effectiveness in the intercompany area. It enables transactions recorded in the accounting of a company related to another company of the same group to be automatically allocated in the accounts of that partner. What happens in practice is quite different: either groups don't acquire that option or they don't use it.

The hope that such situation develops positively in the future once again will find its sources in new technologies.

Some software companies have developed inter-company balance reconciliation software based on internet communication properties combined with web software functionality that removes all geographical and time constraints.

In practice, from the standpoint of principles, this means that:

- All of the companies of a perimeter enter their intercompany positions via the web  
Information can be provided freely according to the level of detail available (balances or transaction amounts)  
- Companies can carry the reconciliation process at any time without any intervention from the consolidation managers and therefore understand the extent of their mutual disagreements  
- Reconciliation is deemed completed, with an explanation provided for residual differences, at a time decided by the group.

For the first time in forty years of dealing with the intercompany issue, not only do benefits appear important, but they are imbedded in the long run.

The right tool exists today. Groups must become aware of the benefits of making an investment in this respect, despite the overwhelming feeling of contributing to accounting errors in their companies and to an activity which is, when all is said and done, not directly profitable.

Yet, this step must be taken to ensure optimisation of the consolidation process!
