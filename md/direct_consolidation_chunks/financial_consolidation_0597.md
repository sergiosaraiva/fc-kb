# Direct consolidation technique

This consolidation technique requires to be more careful.

First, we have to calculate the indirect financial percentage for companies A and B which are respectively  80%  for A and  24% = 80% 30%  for B. That's indeed the percentage we will use to calculate the group part in the Equity of company B.

On the other hand, let's take temporarily the place of the  3^{rd}  Parties which are present as shareholders of company A. It is clear that the value of their shares depends on  30%  of the value of B. Moreover, if B paid dividends, these  3^{rd}  Parties would receive indirectly  6% = 20% \times 30%  of them.

That means we have to consider the existence of a minority interest percentage of  6%  in company B, besides the fact that this company is consolidated with the equity method.

Here are the consolidated accounts by applying the direct technique and we can see there are the same as the ones we obtained by the stage consolidation.


|   | P + | A + B |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 300 |
| Equity value | 60 | Result | 50 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(A) | 114 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(B) | 8 |
|   |   | Minority int. (A) | 56 |
|   |   | Minority int. (B) | 12 |
| Other assets | 1,900 | Other liabilities | 920 |


Here are the corresponding comments

- Consolidated reserves (A) = 114 = 80% * [200 + 100 + 30] - 150  
- Consolidated reserves (B)  = 8 = 24%  * [100 + 80 + 20] - 80% * 50  
Minority interests (A)  = 56 = 20%  \* [200 + 100 + 30] - 20% \* 50  
Minority interests (B) = 12 = 6% * [100 + 80 + 20]  
Equity value  = 60 = [24% + 6%]^{*} [100 + 80 + 20]

The Consolidated reserves of B are calculated with the indirect financial percentage in the equity and the financial percentage in A, just as explained in Part 2.

Minority interests in A are calculated on the basis of its equity less the financial investments.

The equity value of company B is calculated on the basis of its equity in which we apply the indirect financial percentage (24%) plus the  3^{rd}  Parties percentage (6%).

The addition of both percentages is called the integration percentage, which is equal to  30% . This definition is to be compared to a global integration

company for which we apply also an integration percentage on all assets and liabilities. This integration percentage is  100%  equal to the group percentage plus the  3^{rd}  Parties percentage.

What happens if we don't apply this particularity?

The consolidated accounts will remain in balance and unfortunately we will not get a red light saying something is wrong.
