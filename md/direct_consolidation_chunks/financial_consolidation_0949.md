## Do not accept different versions of a bundle

The sooner the date we receive the bundles, the more risk we have to receive temporary figures. Very often companies feel guilty to send such bundles and prefer to send an improved version some days later. Unless the changes are really material, do not accept these new versions.

Why?

In the meantime, you may have done some slight changes like reclassification of accounts and flows. Maybe you already gave the bundle to the consolidation Auditors. That's the best way to enter into a messy situation with planning problems at the end.
