In B accounts, we also consider the group value of the stocks and this is the reason of the credit 50 with a counterpart on the Reserves account again.

Notice that both Reserves accounts are impacted together for a net value of zero if each company A and B is owned at the same financial percentage.


| B (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 350 | Capital | 800 |
|   | (b)(50) | Reserves | 0 |
|   |   | (b)(50) |   |
| Cash | 450 | Result | 0 |
| Purchases/A | 350 | Sales/B | 0 |
|   | (b)(50) |   |   |
| Stocks var. | (350) | Stocks var. | 0 |
|   | (b) | 50 |   |
| Result | 0 |   |   |


As the stocks purchased have a value of 300, we have to correct the values in the P&L to be consistent. That's a good point because now intercompany positions are again in line.
