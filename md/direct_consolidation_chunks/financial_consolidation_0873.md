### 1.1 The very initial choices

When the management of a group takes the decision to establish consolidated accounts, whatever may be the objective (official publication or restricted use to the attention of the Bankers for example), they should know that it implies a double commitment.

On the one hand, it inaugurates a new picture of their group in a context of continuity and for a long time.

On the other hand, they will have to involve group companies, each company having to play a new role in a logic of planning, reporting, control and follow-up.

And the motivation of these companies will constitute a key element in the organization.

With regard to the importance of the decision to consolidate for the first time, some initial choices appear critical to us to ensure the success of the project.
