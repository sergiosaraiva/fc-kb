After translation of the whole balance sheet at closing rate 1.6, we adjust equity accounts as follows

Adjustment (4) reclassifies 400 to translation adjustment because historical rate for this account is 1.2 instead of 1.6.

Adjustment (5) reclassifies 280 to translation adjustment because the amount of reserves of 600 CUR consists of 500 CUR at historical of 1.1 and 100 CUR transferred from the Year 1 profit, initially translated at average rate of 1.3, which gives a historical amount of  500 * 1.1 + 100 * 1.3 = 680  instead of 960.

Adjustment (6) reclassifies 60 to translation adjustment because profit must be translated at average rate 1.4 instead of closing rate 1.6.
