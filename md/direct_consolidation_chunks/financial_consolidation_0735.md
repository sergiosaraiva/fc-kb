## Minority interests evolution


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | % variations |  |  | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| (1) | (2) | (3) |   |   |   |   |
| A | 0 | 18 | 300 |   |   | 318 |
| B | 380 | 28 |   | (132) | (333) | (57) |
|   | 380 | 46 | 300 | (132) | (333) | 261 |


Year 2 results are just the  3^{rd}  Parties part in the adjusted profit of each company and nothing special needs to be said about that. Let's focus rather on the percentages variations.

Column (1): There were no Minority interests in company A at the end of Year 1. But suddenly, on first day of Year 2, the group structure is such that we now have  6%  of Minority interests in the opening equity, that is  300 = 6%  \*  [3000 + 20001]

Column (2): In Year 2,  3^{rd}  Parties have now  20%  of the adjustments (b) and (d) impacting company B equity, that is  \((132) = 20%^{*}[(160) + (500)]\)  and nothing in Year 1.

Column (3): In Year 2,  3rd  Parties have now  20%  of the adjusted financial investment in company A that is  \((333) = 20% * [2500 + (500) + (400) + 65]\)  and nothing in Year 1.

And to conclude, if the first feeling indeed was that nothing has changed in this group, the above explanations show some difficult and technical requirements of the consolidation.
