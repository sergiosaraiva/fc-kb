## ALPHA - Column (9)

In statutory accounts, the  40%  GAMMA shares valuated at 1200 are disposed for a price of 800 giving a loss of 400.

In consolidated accounts, the value of these shares is  \(440 = 40% * [2000 + (900)]\)  where figures between brackets are the equity at time of disposal. Moreover, a corresponding part of the remaining goodwill has also to be eliminated against the P&L. We speak about  \(80 = [40% / 70%]^{*} [700 + (560)]\) . Compared to the disposal price of 800, the consolidated gain is  280 = 800 - 440 - 80 .

The final adjustment eliminates the statutory loss for 400 and book a complementary gain of 280.
