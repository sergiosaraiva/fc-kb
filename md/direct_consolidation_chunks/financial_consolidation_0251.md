### Main reasons to find disaaregement between intercompany positions?

The experience shows that it is rather difficult for companies in a group to produce matched intercompany positions and for a certain number of reasons that we can explain

<!-- ========== CHUNK 9: DOC0038_pages_9_251127_153615.md ========== -->

- If a group contains a large number of companies or if the group increases its consolidation scope by acquiring new companies, the risk exists for companies to forget some intercompany positions or to indicate wrong partners.  
- An important number of unmatched transactions can come from a lack of information in some local accounting systems. Some of them just don't give the possibility to keep track of intercompany information.  
- A group without internal procedures can also meet problems with intercompany. A typical example is an invoice sent to the production manager instead of the accounting department, with consequence that such invoice is not booked and gives an unmatched situation with the turnover in the partner accounts.  
- Besides the fact a group relies on organized procedures, using professional ERP systems with well trained employees in all companies, one cannot avoid that a transaction between two foreign companies will probably generate some differences because of the currency rates used in each accounting system.  
- Moreover, we cannot avoid some accounting practices leading to unmatched transactions. The most frequent one consisting for a company to send an invoice with an impact on the turnover when the partner decides to capitalize the corresponding amount. That means an intercompany turnover in one company but no intercompany purchase in the other company.

Finally, we are justifying that is normal for a group to produce unmatched transactions. Of course, we can hope that this number remains reasonable.
