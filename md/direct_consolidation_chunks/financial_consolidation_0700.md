# 3.4 Change of consolidation method during the year

The objective of this case study is to see how to handle the balance sheet and the P&L of a group when one company is changing its consolidation method somewhere during the year. The reasons of a change in a consolidation method are rather diversified, but we can identify mainly

Additional acquisition of shares giving the control to the shareholder

- Disposal of shares with a loss of control  
- No transaction on shares, but an agreement between shareholders giving the control to one shareholder independently of the number of shares owned.

In the case we are presenting hereunder, we will focus on the impact of the consolidation method changes in the balance sheet, the P&L and the evolution of some specific accounts as consolidated reserves, minority interests and equity value.
