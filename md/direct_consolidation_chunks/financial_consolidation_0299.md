## The situation

Up to now, we have seen some examples of consolidation adjustments which are booked because of group's evaluation rules or because of a group profit which has no economic meaning with regard to the basic consolidation principles. This means that if these adjustments would not have been booked, someone not having a knowledge of what is happening in that group wouldn't be aware of the fact. To say it in another way, not booking such adjustments doesn't generate technical or visible errors in a consolidation.

This last comment is not true for some other transactions in a group like dividends paid by a company to its shareholders, acquisition or disposal of a company, ... For these events, it is absolutely compulsory to book some adjustments. Not booking them would lead to visible errors again.

We are going to illustrate this problem with some of these events, the first one being the dividends.

We consider a company A owned by the parent company P with a financial percentage of  80%  and this percentage is maintained unchanged during Year 1 and Year 2.

At the end of Year 1, company A pays a dividend of 10 to its shareholders, which means that P books a gross dividend of  8 = 80% * 10 . At the same time, P decides to pay a dividend of 15 to its own shareholders.

Here are the statutory accounts of P and A for Year 1 and Year 2


| P (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital | 200 |
| Reserves | 100 |   |   |
| Result | 30 |   |   |
| Other assets | 420 | Other liabilities | 170 |



| P (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital | 200 |
|   |   | Reserves | 115 |
|   |   | Result | 45 |
| Other assets | 530 | Other liabilities | 250 |



| A (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
|   |   | Capital 100 |
|   |   | Reserves 50 |
|   |   | Result 20 |
| Other assets | 400 | Other liabilities 230 |



| A (Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
|   |   | Capital 100 |
|   |   | Reserves 60 |
|   |   | Result 30 |
| Other assets | 540 | Other liabilities 350 |


with the following remarks

- We see by considering the Result and Reserves accounts that indeed P is paying a gross dividend of 15  
- Same remark for company A paying a gross dividend of 10  
- For some practical reasons, we will not consider the P&L but it is understood that the  \mathbb{P}  profit of 45 includes a dividend received for 8
