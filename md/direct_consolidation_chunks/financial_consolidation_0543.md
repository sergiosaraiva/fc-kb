# Chunk 543: Consolidation Sequence:

## Context

This section explains minority interest calculations. Contains formula: md ========== -->.

## Content

## Consolidation Sequence:
1. Consolidate B into A
2. Consolidate A+B into P
3. Or use direct consolidation technique



|   | Year 1 | Div. - | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity | 1,000 | (100) | 900 |
| Minority interests | 520 | (52) | 468 |


which decreases from 1000 to 900 by dividends for 100.

The consolidation process calculates the minority interests of  52%  in each amount of the line and we use it in one of the notes to the accounts to justify the evolution of this item.

On the other hand, we know that in the cash flow statement we have to show the dividends paid to  3^{rd}  Parties as being classically equal to the  3^{rd}  Parties percentage times the "Dividends" flow amount, so (52).

And this will lead to a cash flow statement with an error.

Let's "think" cash.

<!-- ========== CHUNK 24: DOC0038_pages_24_251127_160143.md ========== -->

When company B pays its dividends,  40 = 40%  * 100 goes (definitely) to the bank account of the direct  3^{rd}  Parties and  60 = 60%  * 100 goes to the bank account of company A. This company being consolidated with the global method, these 60 are integrated at 100% in the final consolidated accounts.

The conclusion is that the cash flow statement should show a payment to  3^{rd}  Parties for only 40 and not 52.

Our recommendation here should be to check how this event has been parameterized in your consolidation software. Not sure it is correctly done...
