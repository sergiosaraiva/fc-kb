## The adjustments - Year 1

Now, the difficult point is that the group does not accept R&D (IFRS approach) in the intangible assets and asks the company to book them as an expense of the year.

That approach requires consolidation adjustments that will be booked in consolidation and not in the statutory accounts.

Here are the accounts with the consolidation adjustments.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| R&D (Acq. Value) | 120 | Capital | 500 |
| (b) | (120) |   |   |
| R&D (Deprec.) | (40) | Reserves | 0 |
| (a) | 40 |   |   |
| Deferred tax | (a) | Result | 112 |
| (b) | 36 | (a) | 28 |
|   |   | (b) | (84) |
| Cash | 580 | Tax payables | 48 |
| Purchases | 700 | Sales | 900 |
| (b) | 120 |   |   |
| Depreciation | 40 |   |   |
| (a) | (40) |   |   |
| Tax (Real) | 48 |   |   |
| Tax (Deferred) | (a) | 12 |   |
| (b) | (36) |   |   |
| Result | 112 |   |   |
| (a) | 28 |   |   |
| (b) | (84) |   |   |


Adjustment (a) reverses the statutory depreciation of 40, but includes a deferred tax effect of  30%  giving a net impact of result for 28.

Adjustment (b) reverses the statutory gross value of R&D for 120, again with a deferred tax effect of  30%  giving a net impact of result for (84) and an asset deferred tax of  36 = 30% * 120 .

Statutory and adjusted profits before tax are represented in the report below


| Tax proof Year 1 | Statutory | Consolidation |
| :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Profit before tax | 160 | 80 |
| Tax (Real) | 48 | 48 |
| Tax (Deferred) | 0 | (24) |
| Calculated tax rate | 30% | 30% |


which shows that real and deferred taxes, considered together, give the expected tax rate of  30% .
