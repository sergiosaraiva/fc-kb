### Consolidated reserves evolution


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends - | Dividends + | Transfers | Dividends P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| P | 656 | (84) |   | 200 | 220 | 0 | 992 |
| A | 460 | 25 | (200) |   | (130) |   | 155 |
| B | 180 | 60 |   |   | (90) |   | 150 |
|   | 1,296 | 1 | (200) | 200 | 0 | 0 | 1,297 |


The only issue we want to point out concerns the transferred amounts. We find here the same property as when the group sells a single company: the consolidated reserves attached to the shares disposed are transferred to the company selling these shares.

Considering here shares related to a subgroup doesn't change this property.

The amount of (130) concerning company A corresponds to  50% = 50% / 100%  of its consolidated reserves after having paid the 200 dividends, so  \((130) = 50% * [460 + (200)]\) .

The amount of 90 concerning company B corresponds to  50% = 20% /40%  of its consolidated reserves of 180.

These two amounts are transferred to company P for a total of 220.

All the other figures are directly exported from the consolidated accounts.
