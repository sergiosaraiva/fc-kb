## where

- Consolidated reserves (A)  = {32} = {40}% {}^{ * }\left\lbrack  {{200} + {100} + {30}}\right\rbrack  - {100}  
- Consolidated reserves (B)  = 4 = 12%  * [100 + 80 + 20] - 40% * 50  
Equity value (A)  = 112 = 40%  \* [200 + 100 + 30] - 40% \* 50  
Equity value (B)  = 24 = 12%  \* [100+80+20]

On the Consolidated reserves side, nothing new to explain. We just apply the well-known formulas.

On the Equity values side, two remarks must be mentioned

- First, the percentage used to evaluate the equity is the group percentage. We could say it is the integration percentage but the  3^{rd}  Parties percentage being zero, group and integration percentages are equal.  
- Second, for company A, the equity value is calculated on what is called the "net equity" which is the equity less the financial investments in the consolidated companies.

When taking into account these two remarks, we get the same consolidated accounts as those obtained by the stage technique.
