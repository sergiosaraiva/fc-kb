## The situation

Interim dividend is a dividend decided during the current year instead of a classical dividend that is decided at the end of current year and paid after the general meeting, a few months after the closing.

The reason to pay an interim dividend is generally to transfer cash to the shareholder earlier than what would happen with a classical dividend. It is also a way to improve the current year statutory profit of the shareholder.

In consolidation, we are faced to a similar problem of double impact on the consolidated profit, once in the company paying the interim dividend and once in the shareholders' accounts receiving it. And moreover, this double impact occurs during the same year.

We thus have to eliminate the financial income booked in the shareholders' accounts in a similar way we did it for the two previous situations.

However, we will not develop again a complete case study but we will focus on how to book that interim dividend in both company A accounts and shareholders' accounts.
