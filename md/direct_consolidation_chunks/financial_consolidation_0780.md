## Definitive deconsolidation

This is typically the case for a company

- Whose figures become lower than some thresholds of materiality  
- For which costs to collect the figures are too high with regard to the impact in the consolidated accounts

Systematically late in producing its reporting and, consequently, being responsible for unacceptable planning delays  
- With no internal qualified human resources, implying the need of subcontractors and additional costs

For such situations, decisions to deconsolidate may be either definitive or taken in the long term.
