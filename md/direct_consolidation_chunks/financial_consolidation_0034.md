### 2.1 Step I: Identify the companies to include in the consolidation scope

A group is just a set of companies. Most of them remain unchanged, some others disappear because of a disposal or a merge, some new companies are entering the consolidation scope and the level of control in some companies may also change because of acquisitions or disposals of shares, implying a change in consolidation methods.

It is highly recommended that the persons in charge of a consolidation remain informed of all events of this type, all along the year, because of the impact on the consolidated figures.

For each individual company,

Calculate the control percentage owned by the group  
Consequently, adapt if necessary, its consolidation method  
Calculate the indirect financial percentage.

These notions will be completely defined in the next chapter but keep already in mind that a control percentage is necessary to fix the consolidation method and all calculations on equity are processed with the financial percentage.

Of course, we also recommend defining a materiality level for new companies to enter the consolidation scope. Be careful about the fact that a small company expected to have a weak contribution to consolidated figures should remain outside the consolidation scope. Very often, small companies are responsible for planning issues.
