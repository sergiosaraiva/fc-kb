## The consolidated cash flow statement

With these three statutory cash flow statements, we are ready to apply the following methodology which consists in adding first these three cash flow statements together. Of course, we will get a technically correct cash flow statement but it will be premature to call it consolidated cash flow statement.

Why?

Because we will have to take into account some of the events which are at this time reflected directly from the statutory accounts but should be adapted to the consolidation requirements.

In the column "Total" hereunder we find the three cash flow statements simply added together.
