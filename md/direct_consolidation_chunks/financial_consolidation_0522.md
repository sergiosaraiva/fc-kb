### Adjustment J4

This last comment concerns the sale of  20%  of the shares of company A. In the statutory accounts the 200 book value of these shares has been disposed for a price of 350, giving a gain of  150 = 350 - 200 .

In consolidation we know that the value of these  20%  is the corresponding part of the equity on that date, that is  324 = 20% * [1000 + 600 + 50 - 30] , giving a gain of only  26 = 350 - 324 . In such situation, we have to book a consolidation adjustment correcting the statutory gain and bringing it to the consolidated gain. The correction amount is  124 = 150 - 26  and the corresponding adjustment is a debit in P&L and a credit in reserves. Consequently, the net profit of parent company P is reduced by 124 and the gain in P&L is now 26 and not 150 any more.
