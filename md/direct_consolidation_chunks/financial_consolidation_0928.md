# PART 5 ORGANIZATION OF A CONSOLIDATION AND FAST CLOSE

- Entry of a company in the consolidation scope. All flows correspond to the balance sheet accounts on the day it joins the group.  
- Exit of a company from the consolidation scope. All flows correspond to the balance sheet accounts on the day it leaves the group.  
- Merge of two companies or absorption of a company by another one. All flows corresponding to the balance sheet accounts of one company must be equal to the same flows on the same accounts in the other company, but with the opposite sign.  
- The part of the non-distributed result is transferred from the Result to Retained earnings and Reserves accounts.  
- After currency translation, we have seen that a translation adjustment flow is generated on each balance sheet account. Considering the fact that different rates, average or transaction rates, may be used in a single balance sheet, a validation rule should verify that the total of assets and liabilities translation adjustment flows are equal, including the flow corresponding to the evolution of the translation adjustment account in the equity.
