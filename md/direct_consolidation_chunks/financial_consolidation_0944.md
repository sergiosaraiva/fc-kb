## Use mapping tables when possible

Avoid all data entry because it is time consuming and it is a source of errors (wrong amounts, wrong accounts, wrong flows, wrong partners, ...). Each time data import is possible, use that facility including mapping tables for conversion of codes.

Such feature can be applied for

- Importing data into the consolidation bundle or in the consolidation software if no bundle  
- Importing currency rates for large international groups, which avoid to key in rates with sometimes up to eight decimals  
- Importing intercompany positions with partners, which may come from a separate dedicated software

and, in a more general situation, for any set of data that would take too much time if processed manually. This could include some sets of adjustments.
