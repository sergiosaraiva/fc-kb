In fact, there is a limitation in this calculation rule. It works when subsidiaries owns no shares of the parent company, otherwise a different approach must be defined.

The  10%  participation from C1 into P must just be ignored when applying the calculation.

Let's look at the accounts of company S.


| C1 |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Invest. In P | 50 | Capital | 200 |
| Reserves | 150 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Assets | 650 | Liabilities | 300 |
| Total | 700 | Total | 700 |


Depending on consolidation rules, one option consists simply in reclassifying that investment of 50 into "Owned shares" (Local Gaap). Another option consists in reclassifying that investment directly into the reserves, which is compliant with IFRS rules.


| C1 |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 200 |
| Invest. In P | 50 | Reserves | 150 |
|   | (50) | Result | 50 |
| Assets | 650 |   |   |
| Owned shares | 50 | Liabilities | 300 |
| Total | 700 | Total | 700 |


Under IFRS rules, investments would be credited by 50 and reserves debited by 50.
