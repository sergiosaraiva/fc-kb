## Revaluation reserves

In statutory accounts, this account is the counterpart of assets that are revaluated to a fair value.

In consolidation, we have to make a distinction between the first consolidation of a company and the next consolidations.

For a first consolidation of a company, these revaluation reserves will be transferred to normal reserves of the company. Moreover, when consolidating a company for the first time, there is an evaluation of assets (and liabilities), in order to allocate part of the goodwill. If this evaluation concludes to revaluation (or devaluation), the impact is also booked directly on the normal reserves of the company.

For subseauent consolidations, these revaluation reserves are maintained on that account. Possibly, they can also be reversed if not compliant with the consolidation evaluation rules.

The main reason of doing this is to keep the normal reserves evaluated only through P&L impacts. Any other movement on the reserves, without P&L impact, should be booked on this Revaluation reserves account.

Whatever the consolidation method may be, the final amount appearing in the consolidated equity is the indirect financial percentage applied to the Revaluation reserves amount.

Let's conclude with an example on how to justify the evolution of this account by considering a company consolidated with a percentage of  60%  in Year 1 and a percentage of  80%  in Year 2. We suppose this  80%  applies for the full year.


|   | Year 1 | Increase | Change in % | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| 60% | 80% |   | 80% |   |
| Statutory | 1,000 | 200 |   | 1,200 |
| Consolidation | 600 | 160 | 200 | 960 |


At statutory level, there is an increase flow of 200 explaining the evolution from 1000 to 1200. End of Year 1, 600 is kept at group level and 960 at end of Year 2 while the flow amount contributes for 160. There is a discontinuing effect because of the percentage variation of  20%  which requires a technical flow of 200 to put figures back in balance between opening and closing.

This 200 is the consequence of an increase of  20%  in the opening value of 1000.
