# 6.4 Currency translation of flows?

We have seen part of the consolidation reporting consists in notes to the accounts, most of them explaining the evolution between opening and closing value of accounts.


| Opening value | 2,000 |
| --- | ---: |
| Acquisitions | 800 |
| Disposals | (300) |
| Closing value | 2,500 |


and disposals for (300) CUR.

Let's consider the following example of a 'Building account' in local foreign currency CUR. The evolution between the opening and closing values consists in acquisitions for 800 CUR

The closing rate of Year 1 is 1 CUR = 2 EUR and the closing rate of Year 2 is 1 CUR = 2.2 EUR.

As such transactions of acquisitions and disposals may happen several times during the consolidation period, it is the average rate of 1 CUR = 2.5 EUR that will apply.

After currency translation, here is what we get. We are placed in a situation of "discontinuity" in the consolidation process because of the existence of different rates.


| Opening value | 4,000 |
| --- | ---: |
| Acquisitions | 2,000 |
| Disposals | (750) |
| Translation adjustments | 250 |
| Closing value | 5,500 |


Indeed, the opening value is  4000 = 2000 \times 2  when the closing value is  5500 = 2500 \times 2.2 . These 2500 still includes a part of the 2000 included in the opening value. This common part is once translated at 2 and next year

translated at 2.2.

Moreover, the flows are translated at average rate of 2.5, always different of these closing rates. Again, we are faced to a situation which is correct in foreign currency but wrong after translation currency. The only way to put all things back in balance is to introduce a special flow named "Translation adjustments" for an amount of 250.

This flow has nothing to see with the translation adjustments account previously seen.

The difficult point is that for the need of the different notes to the accounts, the translation of flows must be done for at least non current accounts in the balance sheet. Moreover, if a cash flow statement is also required, then the translation of flows must apply to all the accounts.
