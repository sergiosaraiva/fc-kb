## Translation adjustments

This account is booked each time we consider a company whose accounts are in a currency different from the consolidation currency. Again, justifying the evolution is really not easy because of so many different rates involved in the translation of equity and financial investments.

Once the justification is done for one company, on the basis of  100%  of that account, we have to justify any percentage variation in the same way we did for the "Revaluation reserves" account.

The amount finally included in the consolidated equity is the indirect financial percentage of the translation adjustment calculated per each company.
