# GAMMA - Column (2)

This adjustment eliminates all amounts that cannot be integrated in the consolidated accounts. It concerns the balance sheet and the P&L. In the balance sheet, we eliminate all assets and liabilities accounts, but only  70%  of the equity account. To balance this adjustment, we book the Equity value as  30%  of that equity.

We apply the same approach Loss on equity with the P&L accounts and book the Loss on equity companies account.
