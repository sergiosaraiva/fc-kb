### The adjustments

Considering A is consolidated, we must reverse the write-off in P accounts by the following consolidation adjustment.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Financial Invest./A | 1,000 |   |
| Write-off |   | 1,000 |


This adjustment has to be maintained in the consolidation as long as the statutory financial investment in P is reduced to zero. If, in a few years, P decides to reverse part of its write-off because situation of A is improving, we will have to do the same with this adjustment.
