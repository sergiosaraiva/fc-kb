### Consolidation = Year 2

Again, we first consider the adjusted statutory accounts of each company

| Reserves | 800 |   |   |   |

| Reserves | 500 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 900 |   | (500) |
| (c) | 500 |   | (d) |
| (d) | (150) | Result | 100 |
| (d) | (50) |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,700 | Other liabilities | 1,500 |



| B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
|   |   | Capital 1,000 |
|   |   | Reserves 700 |
|   |   | Result 300 |

with the following remarks from a statutory point of view

- The financial investment on company A in company P accounts is now equal to 1000 after a disposal of 1000 for a price of 1300 leading to a statutory gain of 300  
- Company P pays no dividends  
- As said above, company A pays dividends of 200,  100%  of these dividends are booked as a financial income in company P accounts  
- The tangible assets that have been revaluated are still in company A accounts  
- Company B pays no dividends.

Let's analyze the consolidation adjustments.

Adjustment (a): The initial gross goodwill of 360 attached to the  100%  shares is now reduced by  50%  and so becomes equal to 180.

Adjustment (b): By the end of Year 1, the cumulated depreciations of that goodwill were (144) and now we keep only  50%  of this amount.

Adjustment (c): Revaluation of a tangible asset for 500. This amount has to be maintained unchanged, regardless the consolidation method that is now

changing from global to proportional integration. A change of consolidation method doesn't affect the economical view of revaluating that asset.

Adjustment (d): Of course, depreciation continues to be applied to that revaluation on a  10%  per year basis.

Adjustment (e): We have seen that the Year 2 net opening goodwill is 108. Moreover, it remains three years of depreciation still remain, so 36 per year.

Adjustment (f): The 200 dividends booked as financial income must be eliminated in the classical way against the reserves.
