### The currency translation process

Before going ahead, let's also remind that, considering Year 1 and Year 2, the historical value of an amount in Year 2 is equal to its corresponding historical value in Year 1 increased by the variation noticed during Year 2, translated at some transaction rate, which can be the average rate or a certain day rate.

That historical value compared to the Year 2 value at closing rate gives the translation adjustment of Year 2.

In this process, the historical value of an account is equal to the value of this account at closing rate adjusted by all the translation adjustments aggregated since the early beginning.
