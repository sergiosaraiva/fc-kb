### Consolidated reserves evolution


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends | Dividends + | Transfers | Dividends P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| P | 2,000 | 200 |   | 240 | 160 |   | 2,600 |
| A | 400 | 0 |   |   | (400) |   | 0 |
| B | 1,180 | 0 | (240) |   | (940) |   | 0 |
| A+ B | 0 | 360 |   |   | 1,180 |   | 1,540 |
|   | 3,580 | 560 | (240) | 240 | 0 | 0 | 4,140 |


This report needs the following explanations.

Companies: As announced, we show the two former companies A and B separately from the new merged company A+B

Dividends: We mention dividends paid and received in the usual way

Transfers: The column is unique but we could use as many transfer columns as needed for clear explanations

- Company A consolidated reserves of 400 are transferred to company A+B  
- Company B consolidated reserves of 1180 are also transferred to company A+B, but we have to take into account the fact that dividends are already transferred. The remaining transfer amount is  \(940 = 1180 + (240)\)  
- The adjustment (f) consists in booking the reserves of parent company P for 160 and at the same time we notice a loss of equity for (160) in company A+B, giving an additional transfer for that amount.
