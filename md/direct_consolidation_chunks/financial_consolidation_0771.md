## Merae analysis : The new percentage

We present hereunder the number of shares issued in each company and the corresponding value of the equity in order to evaluate the value of one share.


|   | Total equity | #shares issued | Value/share |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Company A | 4,000 | 2,000 | 2 |
| Company B | 6,000 | 1,500 | 4 |
| Company A+B | 10,000 | 1,000 | 10 |


Notice that company B equity is 6000 and not 6300 because of the dividends of 300 that will be paid to the former shareholders. This means that parent company P will receive  240 = 80% * 300  during Year 2.

From this information, we can easily conclude that shareholders of A exchange 5 shares against  1 \mathrm{~A} + \mathrm{B}  share and shareholders of B exchange 5 B shares against  2 \mathrm{~A} + \mathrm{B}  shares.

In consequence, parent company P receives 120 A+B shares for its  600 = 30%  * 2000 A shares and receives 480 A+B shares for its 1200 B shares, giving a final percentage in company A+B of  \(60% = (120 + 480) / 1000\) .
