## How to use this status board?

A certain number of visual checks can be done as explained below.

Check 1 consists to verify that total of column (3) and (4) together is zero. This means that all dividends paid by subsidiaries are effectively received. Supposing this is indeed the case and one dividend received has not been eliminated, then the status board will show an error in column (10). It is important to say that all amounts of column (3) are signed negative and those of column (4) are signed positive.

Check 2 consists in verifying that total of column (5) is zero. This means that all amounts of reserves transferred between companies are correctly mentioned.

Check 3 consists in verifying the dividends paid by the parent company, including interim dividends and allowances. The reason to use a specific column enables an easier check 1. This cell contains a negative amount.

Check 4 consists in verifying each cell of column (10) is equal to zero. If not, this means there is a problem somewhere for that company. Sometimes, it may happen that one line shows an amount and another line shows the same amount with the opposite sign. This means either an adjustment has been booked in a wrong company or some transfer amounts should be put in column (5).

Check 5 is a global check on the total line. Column (1) + Column (2) + Column (6) + Column (7) = Column (9). To say it with words, opening

reserves + group profit - parent company dividends + transfer of reserves to capital equal closing reserves.

Once all these validations are correct, we usually say that the consolidated equity is technically correct. It doesn't mean completely correct because some adjustments of the period may be wrong or forgotten. Moreover, the content of statutory accounts may contain some wrong information.

Anyway, when this status board is "in balance" with all zeros in column (10), the difficult step of justifying the consolidated reserves is achieved and the consolidation is under control for this item.

This status board has been applied thousands of times to groups sometimes having hundreds of companies. It has also been used for so many different activities and in different countries with a full success. Auditors are asking for this status board.

We will conclude by recommending to consolidators not to communicate consolidated figures outside their office before having checked the validity of the status board. If it is not in balance in the way we explained, there are some remaining errors in the consolidation. No doubt about that.
