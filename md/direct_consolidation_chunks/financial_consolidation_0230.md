# 5.3 Why applying a percentage on the investments when eliminating them?

We can start the explanation by going back to the stage technique and consider the calculation of the consolidated reserves of company B, company A being temporarily the parent company.

The consolidated reserves of B were calculated as

\[
70 % * [ 100 + 50 + 10 ] - 100 = 12
\]

One stage higher, we calculated the consolidated reserves of A+B as

\[
80 % * [ 200 + 150 + 30 + 12 ] - 160 = 153.6
\]

Let's now replace the amount of 12 by the previous formula to get

\[
80 % * [ 380 + [ 70 % * 160 - 100 ] ] - 160 = 153.6
\]

in which we have added together the statutory equity of each company to keep the formula more readable.

We now make the following arrangement based on simple algebra rules

\[
\begin{array}{l} 80 % * [ 380 + [ 70 % * 160 - 100 ]] - 160 = 153.6 \\ = [ 80 % * 380 - 160 ] + [ 80 % * 70 % * 160 - 80 % * 100 ] = 153.6 \\ = [ 80 % * 380 - 160 ] + [ 56 % * 160 - 80 % * 100 ] = 153.6 \\ \end{array}
\]

The two terms between [] can be identified as the consolidated reserves of A calculated by the direct technique and the second term is the consolidated reserves of B.

This proves the equivalence of the two approaches and we can state that  \(\mathsf{CR}(\mathsf{A} + \mathsf{B}) = \mathsf{CR}(\mathsf{A}) + \mathsf{CR}(\mathsf{B})\)  where CR means Consolidated Reserves.

Moreover, the left hand side of the equality is based on the stage consolidation while the right hand side is based on the direct technique.

A similar approach can be developed for the Minority interests.

Again, let's start with the Minority interests calculated by the stage technique which were  20%  of A+B equity

\[
20 % * [ 200 + 150 + 30 + 12 ] = 20 % * [ 380 + 12 ]
\]

where 12 is the consolidated reserves of B calculated as  70%  [100+50+10] - 100 = 70% * 160 - 100.

Let's replace again the 12 in the previous formula, giving

\[
\begin{array}{l} 20 % * [ 380 + 12 ] = 20 % * [ 380 + [ 70 % * 160 - 100 ] ] \\ = 20 % * 380 + 14 % * 160 - 20 % * 100 \\ = 20 % * [ 380 - 100 ] + 14 % * 160 \\ \end{array}
\]

and so we find the term  20 %  * 100 which is the part of Minority interests in the investment owned by A. Moreover the  14 %  are called the indirect Minority interests in company B.
