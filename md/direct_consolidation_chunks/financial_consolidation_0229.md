# Chunk 229: Explanations

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Contains formula: the Reserves and the Result come from company P  
The Consolidated reserves of  A = 144 = 80%  [200 . Shows detailed calculations.

## Explanations

From this consolidation technique there is only one step: both A and B are consolidated by global integration directly with P:

The Capital, the Reserves and the Result come from company P  
The Consolidated reserves of  A = 144 = 80%  [200 + 150 + 30] - 160.  
The Consolidated reserves of B = 9.6 = 56% * [100 + 50 + 10] - 80% * 100 where 56% = 80% * 70% = indirect financial percentage in B  
Minority interests of A = 56 = 20% * [200 + 150 + 30 - 100]  
Minority interests of B = 70.4 = 44% [100 + 50 + 10]  
- Assets and Liabilities of P, A and B are added together at  100% .

Two additional explanations are necessary.

Firstly we have to extend our definition of the consolidated reserves, which becomes "the indirect financial percentage in equity minus the indirect percentage of the shareholder in the investment owned". That's the reason why we apply  80%  on the value of 100.

Secondly, we also have to extend the definition of the Minority interests calculation, which becomes "the Minority interests percentage in equity minus the same percentage in investments the concerned company has booked in its assets". This value is called the 'net equity value'. This is the reason why we find the term -20% * 100.

We would summarize the approach by confirming that the direct technique is fully efficient with regard to any complex group structure if we take into account the three following issues

- Be able to calculate the indirect financial percentage  
- Don't forget to take into account the indirect percentage of the shareholder when eliminating the investment in the consolidated reserves calculation  
- Don't forget to calculate Minority interests in the net equity value as being equal to the equity minus the investments
