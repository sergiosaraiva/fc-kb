### Currency translation of Year 3

For this last year, we just have to take care of dividends paid for 10, the capital increase of Year 2 belongs now to the past and is fully integrated in the 12 adjustment.


|   | Year 3 CUR | At closing rate | 11 | 32 | 33 | Year 3 EUR |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Capital | 150 | 1,800 | (100) | (500) | 300 | 1,500 |
| Reserves | 120 | 1,440 | (60) | (430) | 250 | 1,200 |
| Result | 10 | 120 |   |   | (20) | 100 |
| Trans. Adjust. |   |   | 160 | 930 | (530) | 560 |
|   | 280 | 3,360 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3,360 |


To understand the above report, we start again with the closing amounts first translated at closing rate of 12 and we carry forward adjustments J1 and J2.

The capital of 1500 is unchanged in this period and so keeps its value of Year 2, that is 1500. To reach this value, we need an adjustment J3 for 300.

Reserves consist in an amount of 100 translated last year for 940 and 20 corresponding to the non distributed part of Year 2 profit whose value at

average rate 13 was 260, giving a historical value of 1200. This amount justifies the translation adjustment J3 of 250.

The Year 3 result translated at average of 10 implies a translation adjustment J3 of (20).

We close Year 3 consolidation with a translation adjustment of 560 and 1090 in Year 2, so we have to justify an evolution of (530).

Here is the status board explaining that evolution.


|   | CTA/opening | CTA/variations | CTA/divid. | CTA/result | Total |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
|   | (300) |  |  |  | (300) |
| Reserves | (240) |  |  |  | (250) |
| Result |   |   |   |   |   |
|   | (540) | 0 | (10) | 20 | (530) |


For the currency translation adjustment (CTA) on opening

Opening capital of  150^{*}  (12 - 14) = (300)  
- Opening reserves (including non-distributed Year 2 profit)  120^{\star}  (12 - 14) = (240)

For the currency translation adjustment (CTA) on dividends

Dividend paid for  10^{\star}  (12 - 13) = (10)

For the currency translation adjustment (CTA) on result

Year 3 result of  \(10^{\star}(12 - 10) = 20\)
