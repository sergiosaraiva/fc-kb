We are faced to a 'consortium" and depending on local regulations, some countries make mandatory the publication of consolidated accounts for such structure.

How to proceed in such situation?

It is necessary to introduce what we call a "fictitious parent company" (FP) because a parent company must be unique within a consolidation scope. But what will be the balance sheet of FP? On liabilities side, we just add together the issued capital of A and B and on the assets side, we book Investment accounts on A and B with the corresponding capital amounts.

Once such construction is achieved, the consortium comes back to a classical structure with no problem to be consolidated the way we know.
