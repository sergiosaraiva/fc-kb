| :--- | :--- |
| Company A | Global integration |
| Company B | Equity method |


We also give the Payables account of each company, with the intercompany details.


| Company P | 3rd parties | 500 |
| :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Company A | 200 |   |
| Company B | 300 |   |
| Company A | 3rd parties | 700 |
| Company P | 100 |   |
| Company B | 3rd parties | 100 |
| Company P | 400 |   |


Supposing all intercompany accounts are correctly reconciled, what will be the consolidated value of this Payables account?
