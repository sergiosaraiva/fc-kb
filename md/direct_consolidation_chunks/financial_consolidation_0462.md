### Year 1 : First year consolidation for a foreign comuany

We will consider one equity account, the capital account for instance. As all balance sheets accounts, its corresponding amount, named M1 is first translated at a certain closing rate named C1. But we know this capital amount entered the consolidation scope a certain day of Year 1 when the rate was H (for Historical).

This capital amount valued for M1 * C1 has to be adjusted by a certain value J1 such that M 1* C1 + J1 = M1 * H.

So we get  \(\mathsf{J1} = \mathsf{M1} * (\mathsf{H} - \mathsf{Cl})\)  which is the amount of translation adjustment to book on that capital amount and the same amount, opposite sign, that's to say  \(\mathsf{M1} * (\mathsf{C1} - \mathsf{H})\) , will be booked on the translation adjustments account.

At this moment of the explanation, we can state that the variation of translation adjustment for the capital is the difference of rates  C1 - H  on amount  M1  which can be considered as the variation from 0 to  M1  for this Year 1.
