# Chunk 453: Consolidation of Year 2

## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Contains formula: The statutory profit of A is 50 and the group part in consolidation becomes  35 = 70% * 50 .. Discusses relationships between entities: t.

## Content

The acquisition price is 400 for a  60%  of the opening equity of 500, which gives a goodwill of 100. As said above, we suppose it is not possible to allocate this goodwill to assets. Moreover, we will suppose consolidating under IFRS rules with no depreciation of the goodwill, giving the following adjustments in P accounts


| Parent P | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill |   |   |
| Fin.Invest./B | 100 |  |


Adjustments (c*) and (d): Elimination of group profit on the assets disposal

This transaction is supposed to occur just after the disposal of the  20%  of A shares. This means the seller is owned at  70%  and the acquirer is owned at  60% . The statutory profit of A is 50 and the group part in consolidation becomes  35 = 70% * 50 .

Because of these different percentages, we have to split these 35 into  30 = 60%  * 50 which is really the group profit and  5 = 10%  * 50 which represents the profit A realizes with the  3^{rd}  Parties of company B.

There will be two adjustments, one in company A and one in company B.


| Company A | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result (*) | 30 |   |
| Reserves (*) |   | 30 |


Notice that this adjustment impacts the accounts of A at  100% .


| Company B | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves | 50 |   |
| Tang. Assets |   | 50 |


Amounts of this adjustment will split into group and Minority interests on the basis of  60% .

After consolidation process, we will notice two interesting points

Net impact on Reserves will be 30 from A and (30) = 60% * 50 from B, so an impact of zero  
- Contribution of A profit for the group will be  \(5 = 70% * 50 + (30)\)  as announced above.

Adjustment (e) : Elimination of dividends paid by company A

P negotiated the preservation of its rights on  90%  of dividends, although it owns now after the sale only  70% . The amount of dividends to eliminate is thus  18 = 90% * 20 .

Parent P

Debit Credit

Reserves

The dividends of 30 paid by parent company require no consolidation adjustment.

Let's now consider the accounts of each company, including these adjustments


| B |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/B (b) | 100 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 220 |   |   |
| Investments/A | 140 |   | (a) 32 |
| (e) | 18 |   |   |
| Investments/B (b) | 400 | Result | 80 |
| (100) |   | (a) (32) |   |
| (e) | (18) |   |   |
| Other assets | 660 | Other liabilities | 400 |
