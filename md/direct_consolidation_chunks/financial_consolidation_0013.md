## 2.1 The structure of the data to consolidate and its processing in consolidation

It's surprising to note that, virtually since the beginning of the 1980s, the information required for statutory consolidation has been presented in the same format, essentially:

- Account balances  
- The detail of the balance of some of the accounts (financial investments and intercompanies mainly)  
- Variation items (flows)

Analytical dimensions of certain account balances.

This is the case for different software packages from a given vendor and in the software of their competitors, sometimes even in very different locations.

To such an extent that some software companies went as far as using the same coding as competing software on the pretext of providing greater convenience for their clients.

In our opinion, this clearly means that there is currently convergence in the approach because it perfectly meets consolidation requirements.

As a result, we don't see any significant improvement in data structure in the foreseeable future.

Basic consolidation processing (eliminations) hasn't changed very much either since the early days of consolidation in the 1980s. There are, however, variations in some countries, but the best software on the market has included them as parameters.

In this case too, and strictly in terms of statutory consolidation, the learning curve is becoming asymptotic and, therefore, we don't expect any revolutionary change in processing. Of course, we aren't immune to a complete, though highly unlikely, reworking with new principles the legislators may come up with.

In conclusion, and to confirm these comments, execution times for consolidation processing are now measured in minutes, even for groups with hundreds of companies in their perimeter. This is no longer an area for consolidation optimisation in the future.
