## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Key thresholds: significant influence (20-50%) requiring equity method. Contains formula: Consolidated reserves  = 50 = 50% \star [100 + 80 + 20] - 50  . Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

## Context:
This represents the first stage of consolidation where A (as parent) consolidates B at 50% using proportional method. The resulting A+B figures will then be consolidated into P.


where

- Consolidated reserves  = 50 = 50% \star [100 + 80 + 20] - 50  
Other assets  = 800 = 550 + 50%  \* 500  
Other liabilities  = 420 = 270 + 50%  300

We then consolidate  A + B  in  P  by the global integration method on the basis of the following statutory accounts for  P


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 200 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,300 | Other liabilities | 650 |


giving


| P + [A + B] |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 300 |
|   | Result | 50 |
|   | Conso. Res. | 104 |
|   | Minority int. | 76 |
| Other assets | 2,100 | 1,070 |


with

- Consolidated reserves  = 104 = 80% \left[200 + 100 + 30 + 50\right] - 200  
Minority interests  = 76 = 20%  \* [200 + 100 + 30 +50]  
- Other assets and liabilities are just the addition of corresponding accounts
