# Chunk 172: Explanation

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Contains formula: to calculate the Consolidated reserves  = 80 = 50%  \* [200+150+50] - 120 (investment of S in P)  . Shows detailed calculations.

### Explanation

At the balance sheet, the major difference compared to the global integration comes because the Assets and Liabilities of S are integrated in proportion to the financial percentage held. Therefore:

The Capital, the Reserves and the Result of P are integrated at  100%  
- The Capital, the Reserves and the Result of S are integrated at  50%  to calculate the Consolidated reserves  = 80 = 50%  \* [200+150+50] - 120 (investment of S in P)  
The Assets of S are integrated at  50%  and the Assets of P at  100% = [50% * 700] + [100% * 10301] = 1380  
The Liabilities of S are integrated at  50%  and the Liabilities of P at  100% = [50%^{*}300] + [100%^{*}250] = 400

For the Profit and Loss account, the accounts of S are integrated in proportion to the financial percentage:

The Expenses of S are integrated at  50%  and P at  100% = [50% * 550] + [100% / 0] \times 900] = 1175  
The Income of S are integrated at  50%  and P at  100% = [50% \times 600] + [100% \times 1000] = 1300  
The Result of S is integrated at  50%  and P at  100% = [50%^{*}50] + [100% / 100] = 125

Let's consider now the accounting approach for this proportional consolidation method.
