## The adjustments - Year 2

At the end of Year 2, no new transaction happens and the asset is still in company B accounts, but at consolidation level, adjustments of Year 1 must be carried forward into the Year 2 consolidation (historical adjustments carry forward principle).


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |   | B (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 0 | Capital | 1,000 | Asset (Acq. Val.) | 280 | Capital | 500 |   |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | 70 | (b) | (70) | Reserves | (40) |   |
|   |   | (a) | (70) | Asset (Deprec.) | (80) | (a) | 40 |   |
|   |   | Result | 0 | (a) | 80 | (c) | (30) |   |
|   |   |   |   | (c) | (60) |   |   |   |
| Cash | 1,070 | Def. Income/B | 70 | Cash | 220 | Result | (40) |   |
|   |   |   |   | Def. Expense/A | (a) | 40 |   |   |
|   |   |   |   | (b) | 70 | (c) | (30) |   |


Company A adjustment (a): This adjustment is the same as the one booked in Year 1, with the P&L impact carried forward to Reserves

Com~anB adjustment (a): We have to reverse now two depreciations, one impacting the P&L and the other one of Year 1 impacting the Reserves

Com~anB adjustment (b): This adjustment is the same as the one booked in Year 1.

Company B adjustment (c): We have to depreciate twice the asset on the basis of the consolidation value, one impact of (30) is for the P&L of this year and the other impact of (30) is on the Reserves account.

Behind these adjustments, there are two methodology principles

Each time an adjustment is booked on the P&L, we have to find the same booking on the Reserves next year  
Each time an adjustment is booked on the Reserves, we have to find the same booking on the Reserves next year

otherwise we would get some unjustified variation of reserves.
