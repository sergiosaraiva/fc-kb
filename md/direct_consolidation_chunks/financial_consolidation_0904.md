### Amounts in cents instead of rounded amounts

We are completely aware of the fact that cents make no sense when considering consolidated amounts. In most countries, and certainly for large groups, consolidated amounts are produced in thousands of currency units and even in millions.

However, our position is to ask all information in cents because local accounting amounts are booked in cents.

Asking local figures in units of currency (or in thousands) implies rounded calculations that will lead to unbalanced balance sheet and, most of the time, unbalanced justifications on flows between opening and closing. We are aware of the fact that working with cents or not is really not a strategic issue speaking about figures. That's not the problem. The real trouble we have with this option is the time lost by company correspondents to produce a consolidation bundle with no errors, considering that an unjustified difference of 1 cent is a mistake.

And for the reader who would need more arguments to be convinced, we mention the automatic import of figures from an accounting system that generally provides a simple mapping account by account, without rounding the amounts.
