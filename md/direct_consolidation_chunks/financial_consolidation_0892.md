## 1.6 The tasks of the consolidation office

Even if a consolidation is done only twice a year, the people in charge of that job must stay active all along the year.

Here are some examples of tasks to achieve and information to be known :

- Communicate the closing and average rates of group currencies, normally the first day after the closing date in order for each group company to adapt their intercompany amounts.  
- Keep updated the consolidation bundle template, the evaluation rules and the procedures.  
- Collect all information related to shares transactions, as

Acquisitions of new companies or additional shares acquisitions  
Disposals of companies or partial shares disposals  
Liquidations of companies  
Deconsolidations of companies  
Merges or absorptions of companies  
Capital increases/decreases

- Be informed in all details about all group dividends paid by subsidiaries.  
- Be informed about important transactions between companies, as shares disposals or intangible and tangible assets disposals, which are generating significant group profits/losses to eliminate.

For each of these transactions, there should be a written note to file because most of the time, related adjustments may last for long in the consolidation accounting.
