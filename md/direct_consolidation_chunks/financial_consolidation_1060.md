# 5 EVOLUTION OF CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS

In this chapter, we successively analyse the evolution of

Consolidated reserves  
Minority interests  
Translation adjustments  
Equity value in the assets

for the following reasons

- Notes to the accounts are required for IFRS and most of the Local Gaap  
- Justifying evolution of these items by giving a financial or economical signification to each element provides a certain guarantee that the consolidation is "technically" correct and auditable  
- All Auditors require this information, even if we must sometimes admit, particularly for Minority interests and Translation adjustments, that the exercise asked is more to demonstrate that the consolidation is mastered rather than to prove the importance of the information content.
