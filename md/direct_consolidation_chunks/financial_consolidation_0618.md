# Direct consolidation technique

We provide the statutory accounts of each company, reflecting the above structure


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 200 | Capital | 500 |
| Fin. Inv./B | 70 | Reserves | 300 |
|   |   | Result | 50 |
| Other assets | 1,230 | Other liabilities | 650 |



| A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 200 |
|   |   | Reserves | 100 |
|   |   | Result | 30 |
| Other assets | 600 | Other liabilities | 270 |



| B |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 50 | Capital | 100 |
| Reserves | 80 |   |   |
| Result | 20 |   |   |
| Other assets | 450 | Other liabilities | 300 |


which are followed immediately by the consolidated figures and the necessary comments relevant to the direct technique used. Of course, it will be noticed that the indirect percentage in A is  88% = 80% + 40% \times 20%  and so  12%  of  3^{rd}  Parties percentage. Company B is consolidated by the equity method with a percentage of  40% .


| P + A + B |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 300 |
| Equity value(B) | 60 | Result | 50 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(A) | 70.4 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(B) | 10 |
|   |   | Minority int.(A) | 39.6 |
| Other assets | 1,830 | Other liabilities | 920 |


- Consolidated reserves (A) = 70.4 = 88% * [200 + 100 + 30] - 200 - 40% * 50  
- Consolidated reserves (B)  = 10 = 40%  [100 + 80 + 20] - 70  
Minority interests (A) = 39.6 = 12% \* [200 + 100 + 30]  
Equity value (B) = 60 = 40%  \star  [100 + 80 + 20 - 50]

For this last account, we consider the net equity of company B which is the equity less the financial investments in consolidated companies.
