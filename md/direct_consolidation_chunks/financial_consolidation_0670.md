### Goodwill calculation

The goodwill is the difference between the acquisition price, 1500, and the consolidated equity of the subgroup.

The calculation is detailed here.

This consolidated equity is calculated as in a normal consolidation of A and B, company A playing temporarily the role of a parent or consolidating company. Moreover, the equity to consider is the one as of January  1st , so without the result of the year.


| Acquisition price | 1,500 |



| Equity (A) | 2,500 |
| --- | ---: |
| Consolidated reserves B |   |
| E uit A+B |   |
| Grou-% ac.uired | 60% |
| Grou e uit ac.uired |   |



| Goodwill | 144 |


For information, (240)  = 80%  \* [1000 + (300)] - 800.

This goodwill is then split into two parts, one related to A and one related to B in case of selling B separately. The criteria to use has to be proposed and accepted by the Auditors and, in our case, we would weight the goodwill according to the net equity of A and B as follows

- Opening net equity of  A = 1700 = 2500 - 800  
- Opening net equity of  \mathrm{B} = {700}

giving a total net equity of 2400 and so

Goodwill attached to  A = 102 = 144^*  (1700/2400)  
Goodwill attached to  \mathsf{B} = 42 = 144^{\star}  (700/2400)

which explains consolidation adjustments (a) and (b).
