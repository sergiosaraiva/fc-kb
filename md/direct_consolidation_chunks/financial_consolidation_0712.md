### Adjustment (b)

We (or your consolidation software) have consolidated company A at  40%  by the equity method over the 12 months of Year 2 and we know that for the first six months we should have consolidated the company with the global integration method.

This means that P&L accounts of company A for the first half-year are missing and must be added in the final consolidated P&L, on the basis of June 30 Year 2 P&L.


|   | A (June 30 Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Cost of sales | 4,940 | Sales | 5,000 |
| Result | 60 |   |   |
