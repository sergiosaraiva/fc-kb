## 3.2 Disposal of a subgroup

Without any specific assumptions, this case study may look rather similar to the subgroup acquisition case seen before. That's the reason why we are going to add some complexity.

This subgroup has been acquired in Year 0 with a goodwill (for both companies) of 360, after having allocated part of it on a tangible asset in company A for a gross amount of 500.

It has been decided to appreciate the goodwill over a period of 5 years and its allocation over a period of 10 years.

Until Year 1, company A is consolidated by the global integration method and company B by the equity method.
