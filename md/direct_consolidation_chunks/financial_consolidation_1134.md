## Consistency validation

It is somehow important to dedicate the task of researching inconsistencies in a cash flow statement, even if it looks technically correct to someone external to the process, but knowing all group transactions and figures.

The main areas to validate are

- Net variation of current assets and liabilities (Receivables and Payables in our case study). Both amounts could be too high because elimination of some intercompany flows could have been forgotten.  
Investments and disinvestments are much easier to validate because most of the time there are only a few transactions and they are well known. In our case study, we recognize easily in particular the acquisition of shares for 4000, the disposal price of 800 for the  40%  shares of GAMMA.  
The net capital increase is also well identified.  
Dividends paid by the parent company need no comment ...  
- But special care should be brought to dividends paid to  3^{rd}  Parties, certainly if the group structure is complex.
