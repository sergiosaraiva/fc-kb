by using a "transfer" flow. Intercompany closing amounts would now be reconciled correctly but we still remain with a problem on flows because a 'transfer' flow is typically considered as a non cash item. This means that in

the cash flow statement we keep the same situation as in the previous assumption. We solved only half of the problem.

The final good solution is to use a "cash" flow to transfer these 50 from Link account to Receivables account.

Our final conclusion is not to recommend not using materiality thresholds. This is a realistic option, certainly in large groups. Our only recommendation concerns the residual amount on the Link account that should be either transferred by using a "cash" flow or by adding the Link account and the "cash" flows in the cash flow statement report.

This transfer by using a "cash" flow can be on the net difference and company per company.
