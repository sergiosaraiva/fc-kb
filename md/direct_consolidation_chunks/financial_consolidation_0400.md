# 2.2 Evolution of consolidated reserves

If we go back to our preliminary definition of consolidated reserves we gave in Part 2 Section 4.4, we said it was, for each company, the accumulation of results less dividends paid since the first day the company has entered the consolidation scope.

Consequently, we can also state that the difference between consolidated reserves between a given period and the previous one must be only the result of that period less the dividend paid, if any.

Moreover, it is understood that all direct booking on the reserves of a company, without impacting the P&L, will be done on another specific account, generally Revaluation reserves.

When we consider the formula used to calculate the consolidated reserves of a company, as reminded hereunder,

Consolidated reserves (of C) =  \(% (\mathsf{C})^*\)  Equity -  \(% (\mathsf{S})^*\)  Financial Investment

we easily understand that the previous accounting relation will not be necessarily respected for some changes in the percentages or in the accounts themselves.

To explain clearly this problem we are going to progress in complexity through different situations and try to build some methodology.

Let's consider the following group structure over Year 1 and Year 2 with the following assumptions:
