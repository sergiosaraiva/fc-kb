# Chunk 549: Consolidation Methods Available:

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes.

## Content

## Consolidation Methods Available:
- Stage consolidation (bottom-up)
- Direct consolidation (all at once)
- Both yield same results


We consider a similar group structure as the previous one, but this time company B is consolidated by A (and by the group) with the equity method.

Direct  3^{rd}  Parties of A with their  20% , have some indirect interests in company B for an additional  6% = 20% \star 30% .

This means we have to calculate minority interests in B equity.

B is supposed to pay dividends for 100.

Here is its equity evolution limited to these dividends.


|   | Year 1 | Divid. | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity | 1,000 | (100) | 900 |
| Minority interests | 60 | (6) | 54 |


Again, one of the notes to the accounts requires justifying the minority interests evolution and here above is the company B contribution to this note.

But we must closely check that the amount of (6) is not imported also in the cash flow statement as well as dividends paid to  3^{rd}  Parties, which would be wrong.

Thinking cash again, company B pays a dividend of 100, 30 being transferred to the bank account of A fully consolidated, and  70%  being paid to the other shareholders of B.

The amount of 6 has no economical signification and should not appear in the cash flow statement. The amount of 30 is not cash because B is consolidated

by the equity method, but 30 will appear as cash in paid by an equity method in the consolidated accounts.

Finally, this 30 amount will be the only impact of company B in the cash flow statement.
