# 6.6 Consolidation adjustments in local currency

The subject of consolidation adjustments will be largely covered in chapter 8. However, within the scope of currency translation, we would like to explain how to translate a foreign currency adjustment.

A consolidation adjustment can be seen as a journal entry that cannot be booked in the legal accounting of a company for some reasons which may be legal, fiscal or inconsistent with Local Gaap. In such situation, these journal entries are booked at consolidation level. When the company accounting is in foreign currency, the consolidation adjustment must also be booked in local currency and translated into consolidation currency following specific rules.

These will be explained on the basis of an example hereunder.

In Year 1, let's suppose we have to book the following adjustment in the consolidation


| Year 1 (CUR) | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Depreciations in P&L | 100 |   |
| Tangible assets (depreciations) |   | 100 |


Just to fix our mind, we can imagine a fixed asset which is depreciated over 10

years in statutory accounts but, referring to consolidation rules, this period of depreciation must be only 5 years. So we suppose we have to book an additional depreciation of 100 CUR over that period.

In Year 2, this consolidation adjustment becomes


| Year 2 (CUR) | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Depreciations in P&L | 100 |   |
| Reserves | 100 |   |
| Tangible assets (depreciations) |   | 200 |


Of course, these adjustments are impacting the consolidation finally in EUR after currency translation. Let's suppose the rates are the following.


|   | Year 1 | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Closing rate | 1.5 | 1.2 |
| Average rate | 1.4 | 1.3 |


The Year 1 adjustment is translated just like a balance sheet and a P&L would be. Balance sheet accounts are translated at closing rate, P&L accounts at average rate and we must take care of the profit/reserve effect that is translated at historical rate.

Here are the translated adjustments of Year 1 with

Tangible assets (depreciations)  = 100\mathrm{CUR}^{*}1.5 = 150  
- Depreciations in P&L = 100 CUR * 1.4 = 140  
Translation adjustments (equity account) for a difference of 10


| Year 1 (EUR) | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Depreciations in P&L | 140 |   |
| Translation adjustments | 10 |   |
| Tangible assets (depreciations) |   | 150 |


The Year 2 adjustment, after translation, becomes


| Year 2 EUR | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Depreciations in P&L |   |   |
| Reserves |   |   |
| Translation adjustments |   |   |
| Tan ible assets de reciations, |   | 240 |
