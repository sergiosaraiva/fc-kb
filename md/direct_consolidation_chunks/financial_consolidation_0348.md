Adjustment (a) shows the 300 remaining goodwill related to the  60%  of shares the group still owns.

Adjustment (b) concerns the allocation of this initial goodwill on a land for 200. Independently of the  20%  shares disposal, the land is still owned by company A.

Adjustment (c) modifies the statutory gain on disposal as explained above for an amount of 170.

Adjustment  \((\mathsf{d}^{*})\)  is the reclassification of the profit of 10 between  3^{rd}  Parties and Group. The  \star  indicates these amounts have to be considered at  100%  on each account
