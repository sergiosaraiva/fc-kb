| Reserves 1,000 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 340 | Result 300 |

| Conso. Res.(B) 66 |   |   |
| Minority int.(B) 154 |   |   |
| Other assets | 10,030 | Other liabilities 6,200 |


with

Consolidated reserves (A)  = 800 = 100%  \* [1000 + 600 + 200] - 1000

Consolidated reserves (B) = 66 = 80% * [500 + 300 + 100 + (20) + (100) + (10)] - [700 + (150)]  
Minority interests (B) = 154 = 20% * [500 + 300 + 100 + (20) + (100) + (10)]
