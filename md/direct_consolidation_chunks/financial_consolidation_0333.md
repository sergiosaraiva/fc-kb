### The situation

A goodwill occurs when the acquisition price is higher than the corresponding equity acquired.

The main reasons are the following

It is generally normal to pay more than the equity  
- Certain values of the acquired company are not reflected in the balance sheet, as

The value of the customers  
The value of the employees  
o The value of certain products, trade marks or ideas not booked as intangible assets

The fact that by acquiring a company, we eliminate a competitor  
The new shares acquired may give the control on the company

Anyway, it is supposed that in case of goodwill, the acquirer identifies the main reasons of paying more than the equity. This approach leads to book adjustments by revaluating some assets with a counterpart in the equity. A new goodwill calculation must be done afterwards and the remaining goodwill will then be considered as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet.

At this point of the process, these explanations apply to any consolidation rules: IFRS or Local Gaap.

The future of the goodwill depends now on the evaluation rules.

In IFRS, a goodwill remains unchanged during the lifetime of the company in the consolidation scope. At the end of each year, an impairment test is applied to each company in order to compare the present value of the company against the value of the company at acquisition time. If that value has decreased, we will have to book an impairment (=provision, write-off) on the goodwill. That impairment has a negative impact on the P&L.

By such a process, the goodwill can decrease but cannot be revaluated.

A last possibility that can be done under IFRS rules is the calculation of a full goodwill whenever the group acquires, for instance, only  80%  of a company.

Let's consider the following example.

A group acquires  80%  of a company A for a price of 100. Its equity being 90, the goodwill is equal to  28 = 100 - 80% * 90 . IFRS rules offer the possibility to calculate a full goodwill as if the group would have bought  100% , by calculating a goodwill of  28 / 80% = 35 .

Booking of that goodwill will be as follows


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill | 35 |   |
| Financial Invest./A |   | 28 |
| Minority Interests |   | 7 |


In Local Gaap, a goodwill must be depreciated on a linear and economical basis. The duration of the depreciation is a choice of the group. In most countries, the number of years is limited.

No deferred taxes apply to the impairment or the depreciation of a goodwill.
