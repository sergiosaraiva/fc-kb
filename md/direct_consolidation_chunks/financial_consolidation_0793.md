We consider the statutory accounts of companies P and A already adjusted.


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A(a)(b) | 500(200) | CapitalReserves(b) | 2,0001,000(100) |
| Result(b) | 500(100) |   |   |
| Fin. Inv./A(a) | 2,000(500) | (b) | 1,500 |
| Other assets | 3,000 | Other liabilities |   |
|   |  |  |  |
| Tangible assets(c)(d) | 2,000800(200) | CapitalReserves(c)(d) | 1,000(100)800(100) |
| Result(d) | (700)(100) |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,500 | Other liabilities | 3,300 |


Adjustment (a): Gross goodwill of 500 calculated at time of acquisition of company A after goodwill allocation on a tangible asset in company A.

Adjustment (b): Cumulated depreciation of that goodwill, consisting in 100 corresponding to Year 0 booked in the reserves and 100 booked in the P&L for Year 1.

Adjustment (c): Allocation of the goodwill to tangible assets for a gross value of 800.

Adjustment (d): Depreciation of 200 corresponding to 100 for Year 0 booked in the reserves and 100 booked in the P&L for Year 1.

Here are the corresponding consolidated accounts.


| P + A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A | 300 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 900 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 2,600 | Result | 400 |
| Conso. Res.(A) | (860) |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 160 |   |   |
| Other assets | 4,500 | Other liabilities | 4,800 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (860) = 80% * [1000 + (100) + 800 + (100) + (700) + (100)] - [2000 + (500)]  
Minority interests (A) = 160 = 20% \* [1000 + (100) + 800 + (100) + (700) + (100)]
