## Define a cut-off date

For intercompany purpose, the group should define a cut-off date in order to avoid the issuing of any group transactions such as invoices and payments between this date and the closing date for the consolidation.

It is interesting to describe the following existing situation.

This group defines a cut-off date for the year-end consolidation which is respected by each company.

For June consolidation, there is no cut-off date. Company A issues an invoice to company B for some products. The problem is that, because of the consolidation planning, company B reports its bundle without the corresponding purchase. There is an intercompany to adjust.

But more than that!

The products are not booked in company B assets. They are still in the truck somewhere on a highway! This implies the booking of another adjustment and, considering the stocks margins, we finally need to eliminate it as well.

The conclusion is to propose a cut-off date for each consolidation, regardless whether it is a fiscal year consolidation or not.
