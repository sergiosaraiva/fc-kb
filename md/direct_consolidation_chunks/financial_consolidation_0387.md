## 1.3 Flows on intercompany accounts

When reporting the figures for consolidation, each company usually provides the first flows on each balance sheet accounts and if that account is defined as intercompany, it should also provide a more detailed information on flows attached to each intercompany amounts.

Let's put this through the following example.


|   | Company A | Receivables |   |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Year 1 | Net variation | Year 2 |   |
| Balance | 1,000 | 400 | 1,400 |
| Company B | 200 | 100 | 300 |
| 3rd Parties | 800 | 300 | 1,100 |


Here is the situation of the Receivables for company A showing first the balance evolution for 400 and then an intercompany position with company B for a variation of 100. The net variation of 300 concerns  3^{rd}  Parties.


|   | Company B | Payables |   |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Year 1 | Net variation | Year 2 |   |
| Balance | 1,300 | (500) | 800 |
| Company A | 200 | 100 | 300 |
| 3rd Parties | 1,100 | (600) | 500 |


Company B shows its Payables account with the same presentation and, moreover, we can observe that both companies are correctly reconciled on intercompany level not only on opening and closing amounts but also on the net variation flow of 100.

Everything is perfect and both consolidations of closing amounts and of flows can go on without any problem.

The situation can become more difficult to manage if we suppose company B presents its figures in a certain local currency (CUR) as hereunder


|   | Company B | Payables | (in CUR) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year 1 | Net variation | Year 2 |   |
| Balance | 260 | (110) | 150 |
| Company A | 40 | 10 | 50 |
| 3rd Parties | 220 | (120) | 100 |


These figures are first translated into the consolidation currency on the basis of 5 for closing rate Year 1, 6 for closing rate Year 2 and 7 for average rate Year 2 giving the following figures in EUR.


|   | Company B | Payables | (in EUR) |   |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Year 1 | Net variation | Trans. adj. | Year 2 |   |
| Balance | 1,300 | (770) | 370 | 900 |
| Company A | 200 | 70 | 30 | 300 |
| 3rd Parties | 1,100 | (840) | 340 | 600 |


We notice now that if intercompany opening and closing amounts between company A and company B are still reconciled (200 and 300), the intercompany flow corresponding to the net variation is 100 on Receivables side and 70 on Payables side.
