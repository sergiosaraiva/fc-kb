### Answer 2.02

The annual profit of 200 splits into 120 and 80 for the two mid-year periods.

Moreover, we have to consider an adjustment of (40) corresponding to an additional depreciation. This amount of (40) must be split into (20) and (20) for the two periods considered.

Finally, the contribution to the consolidated profit is  \(132 = 90% * [120 + (20)] + 70% * [80 + (20)]\)
