## Consolidated reserves evolution


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends | Dividends + | Transfers | Dividends P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| P | 540 | (200) |   |   | 560 |   | 900 |
| A | (100) | 72 |   |   | (32) |   | (60) |
| B | 720 | 114 |   |   | (528) |   | 306 |
|   | 1,160 | (14) | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1,146 |


To understand the following report, we need to split the "Transfers" column in four columns as presented hereunder.


|   |  | Transfers |  |   |   |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| (1) | (2) | (3) | (4) |   |   |
| P | 128 | (20) | 400 | 52 | 560 |
| A |   | 20 |   | (52) | (32) |
| B | (128) |   | (400) |   | (528) |
|   | 0, | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |


Column (1):  80%  of the cumulated goodwill depreciations are transferred from company P to company B, which is  \((128) = 80%\)  (* (160).

Column (2): We have already met this situation several times in some other cases. Each time there is a disposal or a decrease in indirect percentage in a company, the corresponding part on the consolidated reserves is transferred from the initial company to the owner of the shares. In our case study, percentage of company A decreases by  6%  on  30% , giving a transfer of consolidated reserves for an amount of  \((20) = [6% / 30%]^{*}\)  (100)

Column (3): This amount of  400 = 80%  * 500 corresponds to the elimination of the group gain on company A shares from company P to company B.

Column (4): This amount is the group goodwill correction. It has been calculated at group level (company P) but booked in company B. That's the reason of the transfer.
