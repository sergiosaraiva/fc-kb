## How to process the deconsolidation?

The general approach consists in consolidating the company with the equity method, regardless its previous consolidation method.

The equity accounts at the date of the deconsolidation will remain the basic figures to calculate the equity value in the future and so will not change anymore.

Of course, nothing prevents to book a write-off on that equity value at any time after the deconsolidation.

Most of the time, when a deconsolidation is decided, the management of groups prefers to come back to the book value of the participation instead of keeping for ever an equity value in the consolidated accounts.

If so, there will be a final consolidation adjustment to book which consists in reversing the consolidated reserves of the deconsolidated company.
