# Stage consolidation technique

We start by considering companies A and B accounts


| A |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Fin. Inv./B | 50 | Capital 200 |
| Reserves 100 |   |   |
| Result 30 |   |   |
| Other assets | 550 | Other liabilities 270 |



| B |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 100 |
|   | Reserves 80 |
|   | Result 20 |
| Other assets | 500 Other liabilities 300 |


and by consolidating them we get


| A+B |  |
| --- | --- |
| Equity value | 60 |
| Capital 200 |   |
| Reserves 100 |   |
| Result 30 |   |
| Conso. Res. 10 |   |
| Minority int. 0 |   |
| Other assets | 550 |
| Other liabilities 270 |   |


where

- Consolidated reserves  = 10 = 30% \left[100 + 80 + 20\right] - 50

Minority interests are 0 because B is an equity method company  
Equity value  = 60 = 30%  \* [100 + 80 +20]  
- Other assets and liabilities are those from A because of the equity method

by just applying the definitions we have explained in Part 2.

We can now consolidate one stage higher, at company P level, with the following accounts


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 150 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,350 | Other liabilities | 650 |


giving the final consolidated accounts


| P + [A + B] |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 300 |
| Equity value | 60 | Result | 50 |
|   |   | Conso. Res. | 122 |
|   |   | Minority int. | 68 |
| Other assets | 1,900 | Other liabilities | 920 |


where

- Consolidated reserves  = {122} = {80}%  * \left\lbrack  {{200} + {100} + {30} + {10}}\right\rbrack  - {150}  
Minority interests  = 68 = 20%  \* [200 + 100 + 30 + 10]  
- Equity value, other assets and other liabilities are now processed as usual by the global integration method.

So, nothing special to say about this stage technique that works perfectly well.
