### The percentage of control

The notion of percentage of control has already been widely commented here above. It is recalled that the control percentage determines the consolidation method. Therefore, it must be calculated for each company and for each consolidation.

The following table lists the basic principles that are to be applied to each individual company:


| Control percentage | Level of control | Consolidation method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| >50% | Exclusive control | Global integration |
| 50% with existence of another shareholder with whom control is shared (*) | Joint control | Proportional Integration (or equity method if IFRS) |
| ≥20% and <50% | Significant influence | Equity method |
| < 20% | No significant influence | Not consolidated |


(*) May also occur with more than two shareholders. The essence here is that the control is shared between a limited number of shareholders.

Please note that exceptions are always possible, though one must comply with the requirements of the reference framework that was chosen for the

purpose of drawing up the consolidated accounts, whether it's Local Gaap or IFRS.

Let's suppose we have to consolidate the following group. First step consists in calculating the control percentage applying to each company of the consolidation scope. Then, on the basis of the table presented above, we attach to each of these companies its consolidation method.
