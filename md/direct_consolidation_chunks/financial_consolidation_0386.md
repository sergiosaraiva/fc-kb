# Chunk 386: That means

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes.

## Content

If the transaction would have been closed let say on the  1^{st}  of May Year 2, theoretically, we would have to consolidate these flows with the equity method for the first four months preceding the closing and with the global integration method for the remaining eight months of the year. Such approach requires the knowledge of each flow split in two parts, before closing and after closing of the transaction. This could represent a real difficulty for a company not prepared to such specific reporting.
