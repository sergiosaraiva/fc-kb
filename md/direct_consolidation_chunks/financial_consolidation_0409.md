### Situation 2 : An increase of capital in company B, without oercentaae variation

In this step, we keep the same situation as above but we suppose that company B increases its capital by 500. All shareholders are subscribing on the basis of their participation, so P subscribes  300 = 60%  500 and the  3^{rd}  Parties  200 = 40%  500.

Here are the accounts reflecting the situation

Year 1 Year 2  


| Company A | Fin. Inv./B | 600 | 900 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
|   |  |   |  |
| Company B | Capital | 1,000 | 1,500 |
| Reserves | 800 | 950 |   |
| Result | 200 | 100 |   |


And the consolidated reserves of B for each year are equal to

-  480 = 48%  [1000 + 800 + 200] - 80% * 600 for Year 1  
-  504 = 48%  * [1500 + 950 + 100] - 80% * 900 for Year 2

giving the same variation of  24 = 504 - 480  which consists in two components, namely

48 = 48% * 100 corresponding to the group part of the result  
(24)  = 48%  (50) corresponding to the group part of the dividend

This means the capital increase has no effect on the consolidated reserves and it is perfectly normal. The group is not becoming "richer" or "poorer" because of such capital increase. There is just an amount of cash transferred from company A bank account to company B bank account.

This is a pure internal transaction with no effect on the outside world.
