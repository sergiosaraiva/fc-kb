It looks more like a spreadsheet approach with adjustments booked in each company.

We start first with the statutory accounts of each company, one company per column and then

- Column P (1) eliminates the investments on S by reclassifying them on a Link account  
- Column S (2) reclassify  49%  of Minority interests from equity to the corresponding Minority interests account  
- Column S (3) eliminates the  51%  group part of equity and reclassifies it on the consolidated reserves. At this point, equity of S is fully eliminated  
- Column S (4) consists in booking in S on the Link account the opposite value of the investments on S. The counterpart is booked on Consolidated reserves.

Consolidated accounts are represented in the last column on the right, which consists in a simple horizontal addition of all amounts.

Of course, consolidated value of the Link account is zero by construction and we can see that the Consolidated reserves are obtained by adding 204 which is the group part of equity and (120) which is the value of the investment on S in P accounts.
