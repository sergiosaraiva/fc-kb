## 4.3 The equity method

An investment consolidated with the equity method is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for the part held in the share capital of the owned company, including the result of the year.

There are therefore, not as in the other two methods, additions of the Assets and Liabilities with the parent company. This makes sense given the fact that the Assets and Liabilities of the company consolidated via equity method are, by definition, not controlled.
