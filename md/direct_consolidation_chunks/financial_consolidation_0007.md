This was a significant step forward for the groups at the time.

They now had software that handled all of the calculations inherent to consolidation. What is more, it was possible to enter adjustments online via terminals. So everything was perfect?

Not really.

The working method of service bureaus at the time consisted in collecting information during the day, processing it at night and sending the printed reports early the following day by taxi or courier.

In practice, a last adjustment sent at 10 AM had to wait for the arrival of several kilos of paper (listings) the next morning in which the consolidator

sometimes noticed that the debits and credits for an adjustment had to be inverted!

It wasn't until 1985 that the first consolidation software for the Personal Computers made its appearance. This was a real gamble given that the PC XT had  64\mathrm{K}  of RAM and used  360\mathrm{Kb}  diskettes. It was quickly followed by the PC AT with the first hard drive (30 Mb).

They were incredibly more powerful!

The software of this decade already included the concept of flows. Traditional currency conversions and eliminations were handled correctly. However, functionalities to easily document consolidated shareholders' equity and the cash flow statement had obvious shortcomings or were missing altogether. It should be noted that the learning curve was far from being met at the time and many Auditors had to finish the technical work themselves.

One other significant shortcoming was the lack of a consolidation bundle integrated with the software. The technology available didn't allow for it yet and groups created paper bundles which they sent to their companies. The bundles were often close to a hundred pages long.

Their use was inconvenient in several ways.

First, the large documents weren't personalised with the figures of each company, making justification of the figures sent for the previous consolidation somewhat precarious.

Next, if entries were made by hand, the inclusion of the items in the consolidation software also required manual entry.

Lastly, the intrinsic inconsistencies between the bundle tables weren't detected at source, but only much too late at the consolidating company level, without any real possibility of getting a quick correction. Email exchanges were not yet available.

While consolidation software was a great improvement over pencil and eraser, poor data quality and drawn-out schedules were challenges for the following years.
