# Consolidation of Year 2

This time we consolidate adjusted accounts for P as follows


| P (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital | 200 |
| Reserves | 115 |   |   |
| (a) | 8 |   |   |
| Result | 45 |   |   |
| (a) | (8) |   |   |
| Other assets | 530 | Other liabilities | 250 |



| A (Year 2) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 100 Reserves 60 Result 30 |
| Other assets 540 | Other liabilities 350 |


which give, after global integration again, the following consolidated balance sheet


| P + A (Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 200 |
|   | Reserves | 123 |
|   | Result | 37 |
|   | Conso. Reserves (A) | 72 |
|   | Minor. Interests (A) | 38 |
| Other assets | 1,070 | 600 |


where

Reserves of  P = 123 = 115 + 8  
Result of  \(\mathsf{P} = 37 = 45 + (8)\)  
- Consolidated reserves = 72 = 80% * [100 + 60 + 30] - 80  
Minority interests  = 38 = 20% * [100 + 650 + 30]
