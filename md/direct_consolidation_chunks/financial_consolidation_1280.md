### Answer 3.09

We have seen several times through our different examples that when a company is consolidated with a percentage X until a shareholder decides to sell a percentage of Y, the following part of consolidated reserves, that is "consolidated reserves * (Y / X)" are transferred from the concerned company to the shareholder.

In our case, we speak about a ratio of  (1/4) = 20% / 80%  which applies to the remaining consolidated reserves  \(180 = 200 + (20)\) . Indeed, dividends paid must be deducted because already transferred (paid) to the shareholder.

The correct answer is (45) = - 180  \star  (20% / 80%).
