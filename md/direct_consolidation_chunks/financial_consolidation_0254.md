# 7.2 Intercompany matching adjustments: some examples

Unmatched intercompany transactions because of "lost" invoices

The situation

Company A sends an invoice of 100 to company B the last day of the year. Instead of addressing that invoice to the Accounting department of company B, the document arrives at the Technical department and the manager is out of the office for two weeks!

Meanwhile, the Accounting department of B fills in a consolidation bundle and sends it to the parent company without mentioning an intercompany purchase with company A of course.

When proceeding to the intercompany matching, a difference of 100 is detected between both companies.

The adjustments

Company B accounts shows no payables and no purchases with company A


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Receivables/B | 100 | Result | 100 |
| Result | 100 | Sales/B | 100 |



| B (Year 1) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Result Payables/A |
| Purchases/A Result |   |


and this situation requires to book a consolidation adjustment in company B.


| B (Year 1) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Result (100) |
|   | Payables/A 100 |
| Purchases/A 100 |   |
| Result (100) |   |


During Year 2, we can suppose that the invoice finally will arrive at the Accounting department of B. That means the invoice is booked twice in B accounts, once at consolidation level during Year 1 and a second time in statutory accounts of B during Year 2. That's the reason why in Year 2 consolidation, this adjustment has to be reversed as shown here.


| B (Year 2) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Reserves (100) |
|   | Result 100 |
| Purchases/A (100) |   |
| Result 100 |   |
