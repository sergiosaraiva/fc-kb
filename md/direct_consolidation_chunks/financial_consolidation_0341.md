### Consolidation of Year 1

Here are the P and A accounts, including the consolidation adjustments. P owns  80%  of A and consolidates A with the global integration method.


| P |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goodwill (Gross Val.) | (a) 400 | Capital 2,000 Reserves 300 Result 100 |
| Fin. Invest./A | (a) 1,200 |   |
| Other assets | 3,800 | Other liabilities 2,600 |
| Total | 5,000 | Total 5,000 |
|   |  |   |
| A |  |  |
| Land | (b) 1,000 | Capital 1,000 Reserves 500 (b) 200 |
| Other assets | 1,800 | Result 100 Other liabilities 1,200 |
| Total | 3,000 | Total 3,000 |


Adjustment (a) concerns the gross value of the goodwill that has been calculated a few years ago when acquiring the company. No impairment has been booked since that time.

Adjustment (b) books an allocation of that initial goodwill on a land. For some local reasons, there are no deferred taxes and, of course, speaking about a land, there is no depreciation.

The consolidated accounts are presented hereunder


| P + A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill (Gross Val.) | 400 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| Land | 1,200 | Result | 100 |
| Conso. Reserves (A) | 640 |   |   |
| Minor. Interests (A) | 360 |   |   |
| Other assets | 5,600 | Other liabilities | 3,800 |
| Total | 7,200 | Total | 7,200 |


after consolidating company A by the global integration method, which leads to

- Consolidated Reserves = 640 = 80% * [1000 + 500 + 200 + 100] - [1200 + (400)]

Minority Interests  = 360 = 20% * [1000 + 500 + 200 + 100]

So, nothing really particular at the end of this Year 1.
