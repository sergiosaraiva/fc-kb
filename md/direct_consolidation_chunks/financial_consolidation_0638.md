### Goodwill

Each time a variation of percentage happens, we should trigger a goodwill/badwill logic as follows.

On June 30, Year 2, company P owns an equity equal to  49 = 70%  \* [200 + (100) + (20) + (10)].

On July 1, Year 2, company owns an equity equal to  136 = 80%  [200 + 35 + 65 + (120) + (10)].

This means P has a "gain" in equity for  87 = 136 - 49 , but on the other side, P has subscribed the capital increase for 100.

Difference between 100 and 87, that is 13, is to be considered as a goodwill.
