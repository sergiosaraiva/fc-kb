# 1.5 Consolidation of a consortium

A consortium group has already been defined in Part 2 Section 3.7. However, our objective in this section is to show how to consolidate such particular structure on a basis of an existing situation we met earlier.

Initially, there are two companies P1 and P2 controlled by the same physical persons. P1 and P2 are both groups of companies.

The situation we met was unfortunately a little bit more complex because P1 and P2 were owning together  100%  of a common company A. Moreover, there were also crossed participations between P1 and P2 as shown in the following structure. We already presented the consortium with a "fictitious" parent company FP.
