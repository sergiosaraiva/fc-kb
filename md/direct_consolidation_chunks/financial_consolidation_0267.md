### The adjustments

Considering the Intangible assets are accepted by the group procedures, we book the following adjustment


| B |  |
| --- | --- |
| Intangible assets | 100 |
|   | Payables/A |
| Purchases/A | 100 |
|   | Own production |


which has no impact on the result of the company. The "Own production" account or "Capitalized costs" account is used when costs are finally booked as an asset. The only problem we can have, just as in the previous example, is that the costs are in A accounts (employees salaries) and it is B showing the capitalization of these costs.

Fortunately, at consolidation level, we will just see the group capitalizing some costs, which is the correct view.
