## Consolidation bundle validation

The more severe are the validation rules, the highest quality consolidation you get.

A consolidation bundle should include a maximum of validation rules in such a way that the combination of accounts and flows can produce automatically a statutory cash flow statement without any additional human intervention.

From this point of view, the cash flow statement is considered as a high level guarantee on quality of the bundle content.

Our experience over so many years has shown that a large number of validation rules are appreciated twice

Once by the consolidation team thanks to the quality received  
- Secondly by the company who reaches a "zero fault" bundle and has the satisfaction of having achieved a task correctly done that will not generate further questions on the next days.

One final recommendation is to develop a non blocking bundle meaning that when some errors, even severe errors, cannot be corrected locally by the correspondent the bundle can still be sent to the parent company for help.
