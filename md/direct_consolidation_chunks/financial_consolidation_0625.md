Of course, we are not in balance. The special approach is to qualify the missing 70 as own shares at consortium level. It is indeed shares parent companies owned on themselves.

Here is that balance sheet.


| FP |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./P1 | 70 | 70 | Capital | 300 | 300 |
| Fin. Inv./P2 | 160 | 160 |   |   |   |
| Own shares | 70 | 70 |   |   |   |


Before consolidating, we need to calculate the indirect financial percentages in each company. This is not really an issue in this case because all the shares of

each company are owned by the group. There are no  3rd  Parties and so we can consider  100%  for each company.
