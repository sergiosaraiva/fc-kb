## Consolidation - Year 3

There are no companies to consolidate this year. Nevertheless, we still have one consolidation adjustment to book. To determine the adjustment amount, we will proceed step by step as we did for the disposal of shares to  3rd  Parties.

Step 1: We reverse what has been booked in statutory accounts because the figures have no meaning in the consolidation context.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Payables | 240 |   |
| Result |   | 240 |



|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 240 |   |
| Provision |   | 240 |


Step 2 : We carry forward all historical adjustments booked until the Year 2 consolidation.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fin. Invest./A | 2,000 |   |
| Reserves |   | 2,000 |


Reverse of the financial investment write-off.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill | 500 |   |
| Fin. Invest./A |   | 500 |


Goodwill on company A acquisition.

|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves |   |   |
| Goodwill |   | 500 |


Complete depreciation of the goodwill.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Provision | 240 |   |
| Reserves |   | 240 |


Reverse of the statutory provision.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity value Fin. Invest./A Reserves |   | 1,500 |


We now replace the adjusted financial investment on company A by its equity value and we know since Part 2 that the difference is equal to the consolidated reserves.

The equity value is  160 = 80%  \*  \([1000 + (800) + 800 + (200) + (500) +\)  (100)] and the reserves of debit 1340 are the ones we find in the Year 2 consolidated accounts.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 160 |   |
| Equity value |   | 160 |


At this time, we stay with an equity value as a financial asset that we write-off.

Step 3: We process the liquidation at consolidation level by recognizing payables for 240.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 240 |   |
| Payables |   | 240 |


All these adjustments from step 1 to step 3 can be aggregated in a single journal entry


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Result | 400 |   |
| Reserves |   |   |


which is our final consolidation adjustment (g) as shown hereafter


|   |  | Capital | 2,000 |
