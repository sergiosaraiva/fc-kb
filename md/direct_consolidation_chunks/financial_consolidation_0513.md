Capital is increased by 500 and the Year 1 profit of 100 is partly paid as a dividend for (50) and partly transferred to reserves.

Let's now show the statutory cash flow statement built with the flows mentioned above.


| Company P | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: |
| Result | 80 |
| Depreciations | 0 |
| Gain on disposals | (150) |
| Cash flow | (70) |
| Var. Receivables | (300) |
| Var. Payables | 470 |
| Working capital | 170 |
|   |   |
| Cash from operating activities | 100 |


We start with the profit of 80 and eliminate non cash amounts in the P&L, gain on disposals in this case.

Considering statutory accounts, net variation of receivables must include also intercompany amounts.


| Investments |   |
| --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | 0 |
| Financial invest. | (860) |
| Disinvestments |   |
| Tangible assets | 0 |
| Financial invest. | 350 |
| Cash from Inv./Disinv. | (510) |


The acquisition of  90%  of shares of company B is considered as an investment.

The disposal of  20%  of A shares is a disinvestment. It's the cash received that appear here and not the book value disposed.


| Capital increase | 500 |
| --- | ---: |
| Dividends | (50) |
| Cash from financial activities | 450 |
|   |  |
| Net cash variation | 40 |


The financial part includes a capital increase for 500 and the payment of the dividend for 50.

The net cash variation calculated here can be cross-checked with the net variation found in the balance sheet. It's one of the most important technical validations we can do. If this validation fails, something is certainly wrong in the cash flow statement.

Statutory accounts of company A

| Cash | Net variation | 500 | (150) | 350 |
|   | Total | 4,000 | 1,000 | 5,000 |


This company acquires tangible assets for 1000 and sells some others for 300. These transactions are made with  3rd  Parties.
