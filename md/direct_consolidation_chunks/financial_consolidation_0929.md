## Validations of sian of accounts and flows

Depending on the level of sophistication the group wishes to develop in its consolidation bundle, our opinion is that controlling the sign of some accounts and flows increases the consolidation quality likewise.

Here are two examples to justify our position

- A large number of accounts are, with no discussion, either debtor or creditor, as financial investments (acquisition value) or financial investments (write-off). On the other hand, result may have both signs and cannot be validated.  
- In order to produce consistent notes to the accounts, we recommend validating the sign of a maximum of flows, amongst which

o Acquisition flows (+)  
Disposal flows (-)  
Capital increase  \((+)\)  /decrease (-)  
Payment of dividends (-)  
Depreciation flows, write-off flows (-)  
Write-back flows (+)
