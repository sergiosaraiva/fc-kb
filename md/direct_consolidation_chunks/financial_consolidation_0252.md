## How a group can improve the quality of the intercompany process?

Usually, a group checks intercompany positions when a consolidation is performed. The problem happens if such consolidation is produced only once a year because intercompany matching has to be done over a period of 12 months. This means an analysis of quite a huge number of transactions.

It is highly recommended to proceed to an intercompany matching several times during the year and independently of the consolidation cycle itself. Ideally, intercompany matching should be organized each quarter.

For groups having foreign companies, closing rates and average rates should be sent to each company the first day after the date of the closing period. This organization would give the opportunity to each company to adapt their

intercompany positions and to avoid currency translation differences at consolidation time.

There also exist web systems giving the possibility for each company of a group to upload their intercompany positions and to check them with all the other partners. When a difference is detected they are able to correct the situation or to add a comment explaining the reason for such difference.

In most of the groups using such a system, the quality of the information has been largely improved for the satisfaction of every one, including Auditors.
