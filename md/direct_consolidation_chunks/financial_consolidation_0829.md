# Chunk 829: Benefits of Consortium Approach:

## Context

This section explains minority interest calculations.

## Benefits of Consortium Approach:
- No minority interests in consolidated accounts
- Clearer presentation for external stakeholders
- Reflects joint control nature


We consider companies A and B as being both parent companies in a consortium structure (Refer to Part 2 - Chapter 3 - Section 7).

On the one hand, this structure is not so simple because of the existence of the participation of  20%  from A into B. A fictitious consolidating company must also be defined on the top of this structure.

On the other hand, the minority interests disappears, resulting in much more understandable consolidated accounts for external observers.

The two structures are acceptable and we recommend presenting these options to Bankers and Auditors before starting the first consolidation. Keep in mind that such a decision is to be applied in a long term.
