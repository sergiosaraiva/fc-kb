### Comment 1

We consider here the easiest situation of a company having a total equity of 1000 and owned at  80%  by the parent company. Its value calculated from consolidation figures will be  800 = 80% * 1000 .

It is important to notice that the equity may include a certain number of adjustments for so many different and historical reasons that the amount of 1000 may be differ substantially from the statutory value.
