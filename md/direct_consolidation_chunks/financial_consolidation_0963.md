## 1 OBJECTIVES OF THIS CASE STUDY

The objective of this case study is to apply the methodology explained in this book by consolidating a group over two years, and to solve and to document completely with all the necessary explanations.

More precisely, it consists in the following steps

Consolidation of Year 1  
Consolidation of Year 2  
- Justification of reserves and minority interests evolution  
- Production of the consolidated cash flow statement.

By presenting this case study, we take also the opportunity to show how the work is organized. We don't use a consolidation software. All data will be structured with a spreadsheet approach.

Moreover, all adjustments will be booked completely in each company, including the eliminations. The same methodology will be applied when producing the cash flow statement where the booking of flows will respect the "debit" and "credit" principle.

This consolidation will be done in EUR and, to keep the writing clear, all amounts without a currency are supposed to be in EUR.
