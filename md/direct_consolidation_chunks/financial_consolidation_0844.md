## 5.6 Acquisition of a company with negative equity

In non IFRS (Local Gaap) evaluation rules, negative Minority interests are generally not accepted.

This situation usually appears because of cumulated losses generating a negative total. In this specific situation, the first time the equity becomes negative, the part of the loss normally belonging to minority has to be booked as a charge for the group.

When the situation is turning back to profit and as soon as the Minority interests are positive again, these charges are supported by Minority interests.

The idea behind this process is the fact that  3rd  Parties have no active role in the management of the company. The group having the control must support all these consequences.

Now, the situation we want to point out is rather different.

We suppose parent company  P  acquires for a price of 200  60%  of a company  A  presenting a negative equity for (500). This situation leads to a goodwill equal to  \(500 = 200 - 60% * (500)\) .

In the consolidated equity, Minority interests for this company are equal to  \((200) = 40%^{*}(500)\) , which is a negative amount.

How to handle this amount, supposing we apply some Local Gaap not accepting that situation?

We are not in the situation described above of an equity becoming negative because of losses during the period the group operates the company.

The position that has been chosen and accepted by the Auditors was to book the amount of (200) as an additional goodwill.

Each time an adjustment is booked in consolidation, it is important to wonder what will be its future.

In this case, supposing the company remains in a situation of losses, the additional goodwill is maintained as an intangible asset. As soon as the situation is getting profitable, the minority profit is booked on the credit of the goodwill until it disappears.

If the group assumes the company will never turn back to profit in a reasonable delay, this goodwill can either be depreciated or written-off. In both options, this will of course impact the P&L.
