## Badwill

If we start by considering IFRS rules, this account needs no explanation because it is not an equity account. A badwill is booked immediately in P&L except if there is already a goodwill for the same company, in such case badwill and goodwill are netted.

If we are in Local Gaap, badwill is usually an item in the equity.

It remains unchanged during the time we own the company which has produced that badwill. In case we acquire additional shares implying again a badwill, it will be added to the existing one and the evolution of that account will show this new badwill as a variation. In case of selling shares, the corresponding part of the badwill will be booked in the P&L as a profit and the variation will consist in a P&L impact.

However, there are some group structures in which a company A (not the parent company) acquires another company B with a badwill. Supposing that company A is consolidated with an indirect percentage of  80% , then the final badwill contributing to the consolidated equity will be  80%  of that badwill.

Again, if the percentage of company A changes, let's say from  60%  last year to  80%  this year, there will be a flow variation corresponding to  20%  of the opening badwill amount.
