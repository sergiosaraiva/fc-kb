### Explanation

In the equity method, the investment that company P owns in company S is "upgraded" to the part owned in the equity of S.

In the consolidated balance sheet:

The Capital, the Reserves and the Result are those of company P  
The Consolidated reserves are equal to  76 = 49% \((200 + 150 + 50)\)  - 120  
The Assets and Liabilities are those of company P  
Investments are upgraded and reclassified under the heading "Equity value of Equity method companies" = 196 = 49% * (200 + 150 + 50)

In the profit and loss account:

The Income and the Expenses are those of company P  
Is incorporated under the heading "Profit from Equity companies" the result of S, attributable to  \mathrm{P} = 24.5 = 49% * 50  (result of S)  
In return, this has an impact on the result of the Group  124.5 = 100  (result of  \mathsf{P}  ) + 24.5

In a more general situation where there could exist equity companies making losses and others making profits, the final consolidated P&L will present separately "Profits from Equity companies" and "Losses from Equity companies". This is a mandatory presentation required by all consolidations rules.

For those who have to produce a consolidated cash flow statement, notice that the result of S which is incorporated in the accounts of P is not a cash item.

Let's now present the accounting approach.


|   | P | S | P (1) | S (2) | S (3) | S (4) | Consolidation |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Investments S | 120 |   | (120) |   |   |   | 0 |
| Equity value of S |   |   |   | 196 |   |   | 196 |
| Assets | 1,030 | 700 |   | (700) |   |   | 1,030 |
| Link account |   |   | 120 |   |   | (120) | 0 |
| Total Assets | 1,150 | 700 | 0 | (504) | 0 | (120) | 1,226 |



|   | P | S | P (1) | S (2) | S (3) | S (4) | Consolidation |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |

| Result | 100 | 50 |   | (25.5) | (24.5) |   | 100 |
| Conso. reserves (S) |   |   |   |   | 196 | (120) | 76 |
| Minority int. |   |   |   |   |   |   | 0 |
