# And the final question is ...

Your CFO would like to know what is finally the total cost of acquiring company A and keeping it in the consolidation scope for three years until liquidation in Year 3.

Most of the consolidators, with their technical mind, would proceed by analyzing the impact in P&L of company A during that period.

Company A has been acquired for a price of 2000 and a goodwill of 500. This means that  \(1500 = 2000 + (500) = 80%\)  of the equity at acquisition. This equity is equal to  1875 = 1500 / 80% . But that equity contains 800 of the goodwill allocation. The statutory equity at acquisition date is then  \(1075 = 1875 + (800)\) .

As we can notice in the Year 2 statutory accounts, equity is (300), which means that between acquisition and liquidation dates, company A has generated a cumulated loss of  \((1375) = (300) - 1075\) , in which the group takes its part of  \((1100) = 80% * (1375)\) .

Moreover, the goodwill allocation for 800 has impacted the group P&L for  \((240) = 80% * (300)\) , thanks to the depreciations.

In company P accounts, the group had to support (500) charges corresponding to the goodwill depreciation.

And finally, the liquidation leads to a charge of (400).

Adding all these P&L impacts gives a net amount of  \((2240) = (1100) + (240) + (500) + (400)\) .

Not sure your CFO will listen you all along these technical explanations.

Isn't it easier to just say that one day the group acquired a company for a price of 2000 and at the end of the story, it had to pay an added amount of

240 for some payables that company A couldn't face. And to conclude that  \((2000) + (240)\)  is also equal to  \((2240)!\)
