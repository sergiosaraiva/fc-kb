### Group part of consolidated equity disposed

This value is given by the following calculation, based on January  1^{st} , Year 2 equity. The consolidated reserves of B are  180 = 40%  \* [1000 + 700] - 500.


| Adjusted equity of A | 1,900 |
| --- | ---: |
| Consolidated reserves of B | 180 |
| Total equity | 2,080 |
| % disposed | 50% |
| Equity disposed | 1,040 |


Compared to the selling price of 1300, there is a gain of  260 = 1300 - 1040  in consolidation. But the net goodwill attached to the shares disposed cannot remain as an asset and must be booked in the P&L, reducing the gain by 108, giving a net gain of  152 = 260 - 108 .

So we have to adjust the statutory gain by (148) to show the consolidation gain as  \(152 = 300 + (148)\) .
