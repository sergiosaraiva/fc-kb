## Some a general comments before looking to the statutory accounts

The information will follow the same presentation for each company.

The balance sheet has three columns

One for closing amounts of Year 1  
One for closing amounts of Year 2  
- And in between, one column containing the flows explaining the evolution of these amounts.

We do not provide the P&L but we confirm that the only non cash amounts it contains are depreciations and gain on disposal on tangible assets and financial investments depending on the companies.

These P&L amounts are consistent with the flows in the balance sheet.

For each company, we will notice the main figures and then build the statutory cash flow statement. Once all three will be done, we will add them together and book some reclassifications in order to reach the consolidated cash flow statement.

Company P is selling  20%  of its participation in company A for a price of 350. The book value of the initial  80%  being 800, the book value disposed is  200 = 800^{*} \((20% / 80%)\) , justifying the gain on disposal of 150.

Acquisition of  90%  of company B is done at a price of 300.

There are intercompany receivables with company A. The account 'Receivables/-" means receivables with 3re Parties. We confirm intercompany matching has been successfully done and these intercompany amounts are reconciled.
