### Some aquestions before consolidatina Year 2

We are typically in a situation where apparently nothing has changed. The two companies A and B are still in the group and owned with the same number of shares. Moreover, their consolidation methods are also unchanged.

Has nothing really changed?

Well, only the indirect financial percentage in company A decreases from  30%  to  24% = 80% * 30%

By considering the statutory accounts, we will also notice that the financial investment on company A owned initially by parent company P has been sold with a gain of 500, which of course will have to be eliminated.

But there are some other questions about that group transaction.

What about the goodwill of 400 on company A?

In Year 1, the goodwill was booked in parent company P accounts. Now, the goodwill should be transferred to company B accounts, which is the new owner of company A.

And the question is : do we maintain the gross goodwill for its initial value of 400 or do we have to maintain only  80%  of that goodwill, considering that now it is booked in a  80%  owned company?

Since Year 1, that gross goodwill is an intangible asset shown in the consolidated accounts for an amount of 400. Respecting an economical point of view, there is no reason to adapt this "objective" value, depending on the percentage of the new acquirer company.

What about the depreciations of that aoodwill ?

As soon as the gross goodwill is transferred to another company, all depreciation adjustments must also be transferred with the consequence that some historical reserves will also be transferred from company P to company B.

What about the aain on disposal ?

It is a group result that must be eliminated, whatever the gain may be, material or not. But the problem here comes from a transaction between a  100%  company (the seller) and a  80%  company (the acquirer). We will have to consider a group transaction with a gain of  400 = 80% * 500  and a transaction with  3^{rd}  Parties for 100, to be maintained in the P&L.

Which percentage to apply for the equity value of company A ?

The answer can easily be understood by applying the stage consolidation. By consolidating company A with a percentage of  30%  in company B, the equity value is equal to  30%  of company A equity. Then company B is consolidated with the global integration method in company P and a  100%  integration percentage applies to the equity value. So the answer is  30% .

Minority interests in company A ?

We have seen in several situations before that when an equity method company is owned by a global integration method owned at less than  100% , there are indirect minority interests in the equity method company. In our case study, the percentage of minority interests is  6% = 20% \times 30% .
