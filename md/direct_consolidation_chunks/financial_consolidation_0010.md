The general, overriding feeling after a few years with IFRS standards is revealed in the following comments:

- The figures published hide a very high degree of technicality, to such an extent that consolidators sometimes wonder if external observers are able to interpret them correctly  
- It's very debatable how well the objective of effective rule harmonisation is being met  
- The structure of the notes to the accounts means that they are not entirely comparable  
- An uneven skill level is found both in consolidation professionals and Auditors who sometimes find it difficult to stay abreast of shifting interpretations of IFRS rules.

The advent of IFRS clearly created competition. The leaders adopted IFRS standards, leaving no other options available and, sometimes, with a feeling of duty, whereas the other, unlisted groups in the pack wanted to retain national standards for a long time even though some of them did decide to break away.

As for consolidation software packages, they adjusted to the IFRS requirements and the impact on functional changes turned out to be minor.

Why?

Because the move to IFRS standards, with a few exceptions, didn't involve the mechanics of consolidation per se, but rather the content of the statutory accounts of each company in the consolidation scope.

During all of these years, the market maintained the confusion between IFRS as a consolidation problem and IFRS as an accounting issue.

Software packages were impacted in terms of their parameters (chart of accounts, appendices), but not in their intrinsic functionality, or if so, only marginally.

Did the software evolve over the decade?

The main direction taken was again based on technology changes dictated by an increasing need to produce more reliable data faster.

Revisiting or developing consolidation software couldn't be done without immediately integrating a web approach, with all of the accesses and portability that it presupposes.

Not only did the traditional consolidation bundle make way to direct access to a centralised system by each company, consolidation functions themselves

become accessible from any internet entry point, anywhere in the world and at any time.

This approach, confirmed by Cloud Computing, tends to make the location of both data and the software used to process them invisible to users, and to improve performance.

By the end of the decade, consolidators could finally do their work at any time of the night or day, from anywhere, even on holidays, and on the device of their choice, including a smartphone!

This was huge progress since the time of the first service bureau consolidations in the early 1980s.
