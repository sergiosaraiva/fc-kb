# Currency conversion of company A accounts - Year 1

Let's proceed the way it has been explained in chapter 6 on the basis of the following currency rates


|   | Year 1 | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Closing rate | 1.5 | 1.6 |
| Average rate | 1.3 | 1.4 |
| Historical rate for Capital | 1.2 |   |
| Historical rate for Reserves | 1.1 |   |



| A (Year 1) in CUR |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 1,000 |
|   | Reserves 500 |
|   | Result 200 |
| Other assets 4,000 | Other liabilities 2,300 |



| A (Year 1) in EUR |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 1,500 |
| (1) | (300) |   |
| Reserves | 750 |   |
| (2) | (200) |   |
| Result | 300 |   |
| (3) | (40) |   |
| Trans. Adj. |   |   |
| (1) | 300 |   |
| (2) | 200 |   |
| (3) | 40 |   |
| Other assets | 6,000 | Other liabilities |


We translate all accounts of the balance sheet with the closing rate 1.5 and then adjust equity accounts with historical rate and average rate as follows.

Adjustment (1) reclassifies 300 to translation adjustment because historical rate for this account is 1.2 instead of 1.5.

Adjustment (2) reclassifies 200 to translation adjustment because historical rate for this account is 1.1 instead of 1.5.

Adjustment (3) reclassifies 40 to translation adjustment because profit must be translated at average rate 1.3 instead of closing rate 1.5.
