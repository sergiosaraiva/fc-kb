# 2.4 Consolidated reserves status board: A case study

Before leaving this difficult subject, we propose to give an illustration of how to produce such status board on the basis of an example, not too complex but sufficiently realistic to be interesting.

In Year 1, the group consists in two companies, P and A, founded by P a few years ago, owned at  90% .

In Year 2, P sells  20%  of A shares to  3rd  Parties and acquires  60%  of a company B. All these companies are supposed to have the same currency and both transactions are concluded on January  1st , Year 2.

Here is the group structure for Year 1 and 2.
