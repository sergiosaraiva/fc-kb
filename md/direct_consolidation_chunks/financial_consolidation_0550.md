### Differences on opening reserves

The reasons of this situation and the way to adjust it have been explained in Part 2 - Chapter 8.11. But there is a little trap behind when we try to build a cash flow statement.

Here are the accounts of a company in the situation of a difference on opening reserves.


| Company A | Year 1 | Diff. on opening | Transfer | Net variation | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Cash | 160 |   |   | 70 | 230 |
| Reserves | 80 | (10) | 30 |   | 100 |
| Result | 30 |   | (30) |   | 0 |
| Payables | 50 | 10 |   | 70 | 130 |


When receiving the Year 2 figures, we expect Reserves to be  110 = 80 + 30 , and we find only 100. The reason is that after reporting Year 1 figures to the consolidation office, company A had to book a purchase invoice for 10 corresponding to costs of sales.

The bundle received for Year 2 is correct, showing a difference on opening not only on the Reserves account but also on the Payables account.

Of course, we have to book a consolidation adjustment impacting this Year 2 result for a debit of 10 on Cost of


|   | Flow | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cost of sales | Diff. on opening | 10 | 10 |
| Reserves |   |   |   |


sales account and a credit on the Reserves account. In most consolidation software, the booking of adjustments requires to book also some flows for balance sheet accounts. In this example, we book the "Difference on opening" flow of the Reserves account.

Here is the impact of this adjustment limited to the balance sheet accounts


| Company A | Year1 | Diff. on opening | Transfer | Year2 result | Net variation | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Cash | 160 |   |   |   | 70 | 230 |
| Reserves | 80 | (10) | 30 |   |   | 100 |
| 10 |   |   |   | 10 |   |   |
| Result | 30 |   | (30) |   |   | 0 |
|   |   | (10) |   | (10) |   |   |
| Payables | 50 | 10 |   |   | 70 | 130 |


and, starting from this information, we show what would be the effect in the cash flow statement.


|   | (1) |
| --- | ---: |
| Result | (10) |
| … |   |
| Cash flow | (10) |
| Variation of Receivables |   |
| Variation of Payables | 70 |
| Working capital | 70 |
| Operating cash | 60 |
| … |   |
