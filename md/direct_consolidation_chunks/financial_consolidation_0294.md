## The situation

When we receive the accounts of a company, we can check with more or less accuracy that the amount of tax is a certain tax rate applied to the profit before tax. But as soon as we book consolidation adjustments, this relation is not verified any more.

For instance, in section 8.2, we modified the depreciation and consequently the profit before tax but we didn't calculate a tax effect on these adjustments. It is not correct. On such adjustments modifying the result (profit or loss), we should calculate what is called a deferred tax.

Such tax (real and deferred) shows the amount of tax the company would have to pay by booking all these consolidation adjustments in its local accounting.

When we consider these combined tax effects on a transaction over the periods for which they have an impact in consolidation, we will notice that the total amount of tax paid remains the same as if we would have considered only real taxes. But the annual tax rate is much more consistent when we include deferred tax.

Let's consider an example.

In Year 1, a company A has booked R&D in its statutory assets for a gross amount of 120 and decides to depreciate it over three years.

To make things simple, we will suppose that for the next three next years, company A has an ongoing business generating a profit before tax of 200 each year. Tax rate for this company is  30% .

Here are the accounts of Year 1.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| R&D (Acq. Value) | 120 | Capital | 500 |
| R&D (Deprec.) | (40) | Reserves | 0 |
| Cash | 580 | Result | 112 |
|   |   | Tax payables | 48 |
| Purchases | 700 | Sales | 900 |
| Depreciation | 40 |   |   |
| Tax | 48 |   |   |
| Result | 112 |   |   |


We also suppose that Year 2 and Year 3 accounts generate the same ongoing profit of  200 = 900 - 700  and the R&D continues to be depreciated for 40. This means that each year, company A pays a tax of  48 = 30%  [200 - 40].
