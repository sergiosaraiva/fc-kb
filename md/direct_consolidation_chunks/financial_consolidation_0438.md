# Chunk 438: Notes:

## Context

This section covers elimination entries in consolidation. Shows detailed calculations. Discusses relationships between entities: P.

## Content

## Notes:
- Parent company P owns 80% of both A and B
- Both subsidiaries consolidated using integral consolidation method
- Same consolidation percentage (80%) for both entities
- Context: Asset disposal from A to B with group profit of 100 requiring elimination



| A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Tang. Assets | 0 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| (a) | 100 |   |   |
| Assets | 900 | Result | 100 |
| (a) | (100) |   |   |



| Tang. Assets | 500 | Capital | 1,000 |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| (b) | (100) | Reserves | (b) |
| Assets | 1,600 | Result | (100) |


In company A accounts, consolidation adjustment (a) eliminates the group profit of 100 by booking the counterpart on the Reserves.

In company B accounts, we eliminate the group profit of 100 included in the Tangible asset acquired and the counterpart is also the Reserves.

By booking this way, we see that the net group impact on the reserves is  \(0 = 80% * 100 + 80% * (100)\) , but at the same time consolidated reserves of company A increase by 80 and consolidated reserves of B decrease by (80).

Moreover, these variations do not impact the P&L. In fact we have what we call a transfer of reserves between both companies. At group level, the net amount is zero as announced above.

We are aware to present a particularly easy case by supposing both companies are owned at the same percentage. Some special topics in Part 4 will consider more realistic situations, but the principles explained here are still valid.
