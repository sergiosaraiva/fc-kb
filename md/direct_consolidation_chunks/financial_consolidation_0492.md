## 6.1 About the cash flow statement and its utility

Difficulties to understand some variations by considering a only the consolidated balance sheet

The only consideration of the closing amounts of two periods in a consolidated balance sheet does not allow to understand the policy of investment or financing of a group.

The risk of wrong conclusions is very likely.

For example, the increase of an account such as stocks can of course be the consequence of bad decisions at management level.

But the acquisition of new companies and their global or proportional integration in the consolidation scope will have the same effect while, maybe, for the existing companies in both periods stocks may be managed with a good efficiency.

Moreover, the only change of consolidation method will also provoke a failure to understand these evolutions correctly.

Finally, an important jump of an exchange rate will lead to the same consequence.

To face these difficulties, the notes to the accounts will certainly help for a better understanding, but generally these notes concern mainly non current assets and some of the non current liabilities.

Because of the consolidation process, important information is also rather difficult to find such as

- The price paid to acquire a new company that cannot be deduced from the consolidated balance sheet because that item is eliminated  
- The contribution of the  3^{rd}  Parties in the increase of capital of a company is also impossible to evaluate  
- The same can be said for the dividends paid by group companies to  3rd  Parties

and more generally, how to analyze correctly the use of cash in a group?

The only acceptable answer to that question is the "Cash Flow Statement"
