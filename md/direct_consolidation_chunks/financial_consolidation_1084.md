## Translation adjustments evolution

This is a rather difficult report to produce because the content depends on each individual company, on the currencies and not only on statutory accounts but also on local currency adjustments.

In our case study, hopefully we have only company DELTA generating a translation adjustment amount.

Let's first start by considering figures at  100% .

In Year 1, we have calculated a translation adjustment of (940) based on statutory accounts and 30 related to the provision elimination for 300 CUR.

The gives an opening translation adjustment of  \((910) = (940) + 30\) .

In Year 2, the same analysis shows  \(540 = (940) + 1480\)  at statutory level and 60 for the adjustment, so a closing translation adjustment of  600 = 540 + 60 .

We have to justify an evolution of  \(1510 = 600 - (910)\) .

We remind Year 1 and Year 2 local currency statutory and adjustments figures in this report, including the flows and the currency rates used.

The right hand side shows the translated figures with the translation adjustment flow for each account and for both statutory accounts and adjustments.

The total of all translation adjustments flows gives  1510 = 1480 + 30 , for statutory accounts and for adjustments respectively, which is the evolution amount to justify.

So we explain  \(1510 = 600 - (910)\) .
