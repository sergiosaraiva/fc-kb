## Some questions about the transaction

Company A is making a profit of 70 with company B. Supposing that within the same year, B is selling the same asset to a third company C of the same

group, again with a gain, we would conclude this kind of transactions is a marvellous tool to generate profits. Obviously, this cannot be acceptable and consequently must be eliminated. But how?

We can define three approaches to eliminate such group profit (or loss).

The first approach consists in noticing that the transaction is made in the conditions of the market and then it is acceptable not to eliminate the group profit. However we would like to add a comment to this approach. Let's suppose a company having a land acquired a long time ago. This land remained in the accounts at acquisition value. Meanwhile, that land is now close to a highway access and located in a new and well-equipped activity area. The value of that land has been multiplied by three and the disposal to another group company would have two impacts: a huge gain in P&L and a corresponding revaluation of the land. But the transaction being made at market conditions, we eliminate nothing. We think the correct approach would be to eliminate the group profit and, possibly book a revaluation of the land to reflect a correct fair value with an impact in equity, not in the P&L.

The second approach consists in eliminating the profit in company A accounts and eliminating the same amount from the acquisition price in company B accounts. Of course, the statutory depreciation amount must also be adjusted to make it compliant with the adjusted acquisition value. In this approach, we would eliminate the profit in A accounts by booking a "Deferred income" account and, in company B accounts, the elimination of the profit in the asset would be done against a "Deferred expense" account. Both deferred accounts would be defined as intercompany accounts in order no to appear in the financial consolidated statement. Indeed, this is an internal group transaction that cannot appear in the accounts. Speaking about deferred accounts implies that these accounts must be closed sooner or later. Most of the time, the event will be the disposal of that asset finally to  3rd  Parties. If this event cannot be predictable, the third approach should be used.

The third approach is quite similar to the previous one, but instead of using deferred accounts, we use Reserves accounts. In such case, a particular attention must be drawn because a technical difficulty could arise if companies are not owned at the same financial percentage.

The situation described below will be adjusted, based on the second approach.
