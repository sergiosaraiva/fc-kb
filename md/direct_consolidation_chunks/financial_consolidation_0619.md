## Staae consolidation techniaue

The difficult issue with this structure is not the fact that company B is consolidated by the equity method. The real problem is the difficulty to identify stages in this structure.

The stage technique approach supposes to consolidate two companies at a time, starting from the bottom of the structure until we remain with the parent company only.

We could start with P and A and than P and B but then we would remain with a  20%  participation from B into A not consolidated. But what can we do else?

Let's try the following.

Staee 1 : P consolidates  80%  of A by the global integration method

This consolidation produces the following consolidated accounts


| P + 80% A |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
| Fin. Inv./B | 70 | Reserves | 300 |
|   |   | Result | 50 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(A) | 64 |
|   |   | Minority int.(A) | 66 |
| Other assets | 1,830 | Other liabilities | 920 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A)  = {64} = {80}%  * \left\lbrack  {{200} + {100} + {30}}\right\rbrack  - {200}  
Minority interests (A)  = 66 = 20^{*}  [200 + 100 + 30]

And of course, these consolidated accounts still contain the financial investment on company B for 70.

Stage 2 : B consolidates  20%  of A by the equity method


| B + 20% A |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   | Capital | 100 |
| Equity value(A) | 66 | Reserves |
|   |   | Result |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(A) |
| Other assets | 450 | Other liabilities |
|   |   | 300 |


No particular problem with this consolidation where

Consolidated reserves (A)  = 16 = 20%  [200 + 100 + 30] - 50  
Equity value (A)  = 66 = 20%  \* [200 + 100 + 30]

Staae 3 : [P+80%A] consolidates 40% of [B+20%A] bv the eaiity method

And again nothing particular in this final consolidated balance sheet


| [P + 80% A] + 40% [B + 20% A] |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 300 |
| Equity value(B+20%A) | 86.4 | Result | 50 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(A) | 64 |
|   |   | Conso. Res.(B+20%A) | 16.4 |
|   |   | Minority int.(A) | 66 |
| Other assets | 1,830 | Other liabilities | 920 |
