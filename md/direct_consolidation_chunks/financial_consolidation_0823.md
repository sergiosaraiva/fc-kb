### But which company should become the consolidatina company in such structure?

It could be company A but shall we then consolidate the rest of the group, B and affiliates C, D and E with the equity method? This would be of weak interest for the banks.

We could ignore A and begin the consolidation with B as the parent company. This makes much more sense, but banks wouldn't be happy because it is mainly company A asking for loans.

By analyzing more deeply this group's structure, we can suppose that both companies A and B are controlled by the members of the same family and so both companies are placed under the same control.

This means that we would recommend applying the global integration method for both companies A and B. We would then integrate all assets and liabilities, reaching certainly one of the banks objectives. Of course, the consolidated balance sheet would show Minority interests for  80%  not only on the equity of B, but also  80%  on the equity of all direct and indirect affiliates of B. The total amount would probably be really important.

By presenting such figures to the management of a group of this type, be ready to have the following conversation:

Question: 'What's this huge amount on the Minority interests line?"

Answer: "It's an amount belonging to  3^{rd}  Parties"

Question: "That's not possible, because WE are the  3^{rd}  Parties! Can you transfer the amount on the Reserves line?"

If you comply with such request, you will go into some trouble because the first time company B pays a dividend, only  20%  will arrive in company A and not  100% .
