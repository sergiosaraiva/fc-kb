### Answer 2.03

In statutory accounts, the  20%  of shares disposed correspond to a value of  250 = 1000 * [20% / 80%] , giving a gain of  150 = 400 - 250 .

In consolidation, we sell for a price of 400 shares valuated for  300 = 20%  * 1500, giving a gain of 100.

The consolidation adjustment will consist in decreasing that gain for 50 by a Debit 50.
