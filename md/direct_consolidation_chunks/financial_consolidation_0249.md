## Why an intercompany matching analysis?

Let's repeat again one of the main objectives of the consolidated financial statements: to produce an economical picture of a set of companies acting with the outside world, just as if they would behave as a single company.

It becomes then normal that all transactions between companies of a group, whenever they impact the balance sheet or the P&L, should not appear in the final consolidated financial statements.

From an accounting point of view, this means that we have to eliminate receivables in one company with corresponding payables booked in the partner accounts, same for turnover and purchases. In fact, the general rule is that any balance sheet or P&L amount related to another company of the group must be eliminated.

But before eliminating intercompany amounts between two companies, we must first check that both amounts are the same. This is the reason why we need to proceed to that intercompany matching.
