### Amounts in local currency

The currency translation, as processed during a consolidation, is based in particular on the knowledge of closing rates, average rates and historical rates. The technique behind is generally not mastered by local correspondents.

It is the reason why we recommend asking for local currency figures. Moreover it enables a much easier communication between the consolidation team and the local correspondent. Local Auditors are also in a more comfortable position to approve the consolidation bundle.
