### The adjustments

That provision of 50 has to be booked in Year 2 accounts by the following adjustment.


|   |   | A |  |   |   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
|   | Year 1 | Year 2 |   | Year 1 | Year 2 |
|   |   |   | Capital | 1,000 | 1,000 |
|   |   |   | Reserves(a) | 700 | 850 |
|   |   |   | Result(a) | 200 | 50 |
| Other assets | 2,500 | 2,900 | Other liabilities | 600 | (50) |


The P&L booking is done on a provision account while the counterpart in the balance sheet is the Reserves account.

By booking such adjustment, two consolidation principles are respected

- First, reserves are now correctly justified with an adjusted amount of 1900 for Year 2, in line with 1900 in Year 1  
- Any "mistake" has to be corrected via adjustments in the consolidated accounts as soon as it has been noticed.
