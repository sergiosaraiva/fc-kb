Here are, as usual, the statutory accounts of both companies already adjusted, followed by the additional explanations.


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill |  | Capital | 5,000 |
|   | (a) 400 | Reserves | 3,000 |
|   | (b) (200) |   | (200) |
| Fin. Inv./A |  | Result | 1,000 |
|   | (a) (400) |   |   |
| Other assets |  | Other liabilities | 3,000 |



| A (CUR) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | 600 | Capital | 200 |
| (c) | 100 | Reserves | 200 |

|   |   | Result | 100 |

| Other assets | 400 | Other liabilities | 500 |


Adjustment (a): Goodwill of 400

Adjustment (b): Total impairments until end of Year 0. The counterpart impacts the reserves.

Adjustment (c): Gross amount of goodwill allocation for 100 CUR on fixed tangible assets. Counterpart impacts the reserves.

Adjustment (d): Depreciation of the goodwill allocation, so  3*10%  of 100 CUR corresponding to the periods Year -1, Year 0 and Year 1. An amount of (20) CUR is booked on the Reserves and (10) CUR on the P&L.

#### Currency translation of company A accounts

These accounts are translated according to the following rates


| Historical rate | Δ (c) |  | UR) |  |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Capital | Tangible assets | 5,400 | Capital | 2,000 |
| Reserves | (c) | 900 | Reserves | 2,000 |
| Closing rate | (d) | (270) | (c) | 1,000 |
| Avera e rate |   |   | (d) | (200) |
|   |   |   | Result | 800 |
|   |   |   | (d) | (80) |
|   |   |   | Trans. Adjust. | (300) |
|   |   |   | (c) | (100) |
|   |   |   | (d) | 10 |
|   | Other assets | 3,600 | Other liabilities | 4,500 |


where

- All other assets accounts and Other liabilities accounts are translated with the closing rate of 9  
- Capital account and Reserves accounts, including adjustments, are translated with the historical rate of 10.  
The profit amounts are translated with the average rate of 8

and, finally, this translated balance sheet is balanced again by impacting the Translation adjustments account for a net amount of (300).

Then we translate each adjustment with the same rules giving an additional impact on the translation adjustments.
