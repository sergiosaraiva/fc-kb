# PART 5 ORGANIZATION OF A CONSOLIDATION AND FAST CLOSE

A particular attention will be brought to the situation where several "small" companies satisfy the set of criteria to be excluded from the consolidation scope. If, together, the total amounts are above the criteria, these companies should be kept in the consolidation.

We also recommend to exclude companies in the following situations

Companies located in countries in a war situation, in a difficult political or economical situation (embargo)  
- Companies having a disaster (fire, epidemic, hurricane, destruction of industry capabilities, ...)  
Company being in the process of a legal liquidation.

On the opposite, the fact that a company has an activity completely different from the main activity of the group is not a reason to exclude it from the consolidation, whatever the consolidation rules are, IFRS or Local Gaap.

We should also say that some companies may be kept outside the consolidation scope because they are not (yet) able to follow the reporting and planning instructions. Including such companies in the consolidation would increase the risk of not closing consolidated accounts in time.

Finally, we would also recommend to be very careful with companies following completely different accounting rules, even with a different chart of accounts, as banks and insurances companies joining industrial groups. For such companies, if the consolidation is required, then, independently of the level of control the group may have, we would recommend to apply the equity method.

We would conclude this first question by a very practical advice. It's better to have a minimalist view on the initial consolidation scope by considering only companies ready to commit with the group requirements. As soon as these excluded companies become ready, they can then be integrated.
