# DELTA  =  Column (4)

A new translation adjustment is necessary because of the historical value of the equity. Where those amounts come from?


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Capital | 800 |   |
| Retained earnings | 380 |   |
| Result | 300 |   |
| Translation adjustments | 1,480 |  |


- Capital must be valuated finally at a historical value of  7200 = 8000  CUR  *  0.9. After column (3) adjustment, its value is  \(6400 = 7200 + (800)\) . This explains the debit amount of  800 = 7200 - 6400 .  
- Historical value of Retained earnings is  3540 = 4000\ \mathrm{CUR}^{\star}0.85 + 200\ \mathrm{CUR}^{\star}0.7 . After column (3) adjustment, its value is 3920. This explains the debit amount of  380 = 3920 - 3540 .  
- Correct value for the Result is  600 = 1000\mathrm{CUR}^{*}0.6  instead of 900, giving a correction of  300 = 900 - 600 .
