### Elimination of intercompany amounts between intercal companies

In our example, we consider three companies A, B and C, supposing all intercompanies are correctly matched. If not, some consolidation adjustments will have been previously booked to correct these differences.


| A = Global integration |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Receivables/B Link account | 100 | (100)100(80) | Payables/C | 80 | (80) |



| B = Global integration |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Receivables/C Link account | 200 | (200) 200 (100) | Payables/A | 100 | (100) |



| C = Global integration |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Receivables/A Link account | 80 | (800) 80 (200) | Payables/B | 200 | (200) |


For each company, we eliminate each intercompany amount on receivables and payables and book the counterpart on a "Link account". This Link account enables a balanced journal entry for each company.

Of course, the intercompany amounts being reconciled, the Link account is set to zero at consolidation level after these eliminations.

It is easy to see that all these accounts will not impact the final consolidated balance sheet.

Elimination of intercompany amounts in the P&L is done in the same way by also using another 'Link account".

If there is a threshold accepted by the Auditors under which reconciliation is not done, these Link accounts will not be zero at the end of the consolidation process. If the remaining differences look material, it is the consolidator responsibility to investigate the origin of the problem, otherwise we recommend to reclassify the differences on appropriate accounts. For audit purpose, it is better to have all Link accounts set finally to zero.
