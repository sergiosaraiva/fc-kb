# ALPHA = Statutory cash flow statement

Most of the figures in this cash flow statement are just picked up from the flows justifying the accounts evolution.

However, here are some additional comments.

- We are aware of the fact that there are intercompany receivables with company DELTA for 1000, but at this moment we just think 'statutory" and we consider the evolution of this account, including the intercompany, as  1100 = [1600 + 1000] - 1500 .

- The subscription to BETA capital increase appears as a financial investment. At consolidation level, we will have to come back to this booking.

- We know ALPHA sold lands to company BETA for a price of 1500, making a profit of 500. Two flows are used to describe the transaction: one flow showing the price paid (cash item and one flow showing the gain (non cash item). It is the amount of 1500 that appears in the cash flow statement while the amount of 500 is just ignored.

- The same comment is made for the selling of GAMMA shares for a book value of 1200. In fact, we show the price received of 800 (cash item) and the loss on disposal for 400 (non cash item), separately.

- Dividends paid is a cash out for the group.

Notice that finally the "Appropriation flow" which can be considered as a "Transfer flow" is the only one that does not appear in the cash flow statement.

The net cash variation of 700 corresponding to the addition of "Cash from operating activities", "Cash from investment activities" and "Cash from financial activities" is equal to the cash variation deducted from the balance evolution.

This is a mandatory technical validation.
