### Some aquestions before consolidatina Year 2

In order to prepare the Year 2 consolidation, we should adopt a clear position on the following issues.

What about the 150 soodwill?

This goodwill concerns company B that disappears because of the absorption. Shall we keep it? To answer this question let's return to some basic principles. A goodwill reflects a kind of additional cost to acquire an economic activity through a company. If it is true that the company disappear from a legal point of view, the group still maintains the activity within the absorbing company. The goodwill is fully justified because, basically, nothing has changed and the absorption is a transaction that should have no effect on the consolidated figures.

What about the acquisition of the remaining  20%  of shares?

The absorption cannot legally be achieved without being owner of the  100%  shares of company B. This implies company A has to acquire them and the logic of a goodwill/badwill must be triggered, independently of the fact that there will be an absorption just after the transaction.

Supposing we calculate a new goodwill, the normal position is to book it additionally to the former one. It will be our choice.

What about the soodwill allocation booked initially in company B accounts?

This allocation concerns a tangible asset in company B accounts. After the absorption, the asset is transferred to company A accounts and does not leave the group. Our position is then to maintain the allocation and the historical depreciations adjustments by booking them in company A accounts which becomes the owner of this tangible asset. Priority has to be given to the economical view.

And don't foraet to reverse the statutory result of absorption

As explained above, we should ask company A about the value of that result of absorption and on which P&L account it has been booked.
