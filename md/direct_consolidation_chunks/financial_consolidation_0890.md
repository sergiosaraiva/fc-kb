## Evaluation rules and group procedures

The choice of evaluation rules is a must when starting a consolidation process and a vision on the group evolution will help to choose either Local Gaap or IFRS.

As soon as the choice is decided, each group company should be immediately informed because local accounting will probably need some adaptations consequently. This can be time consuming if some evaluation rules are not compatible with local accounting regulations or if some evaluation rules have to be decided at a Board of Directors level.

It is also important to keep in mind that when a set of evaluation rules is adopted, each company must comply with each rule. No exception is allowed.

In addition to a given set of evaluation rules, we would recommend to remain flexible by defining some materiality threshold.

At least two sets of thresholds should be defined:

- One set for intercompany differences. We always recommend defining some thresholds in order to avoid using too many resources for non material adjustments. For instance, one threshold for balance sheet intercompany differences and another one for the P&L seem realistic. Auditors, sometimes, accept such threshold only for mid-year consolidation, while these thresholds are set to zero for the year-end consolidation.  
- Another set for amounts to be adjusted. Most of the time, when an amount is adjusted, the adjustments have to be kept in the consolidation accounting for many years. For instance, adjusting depreciations over a period of 10 years, including the deferred tax effects, implies to keep track of these adjustments during the same period.

Some consolidation procedures are to be defined at group level. One example is the method to be used for the elimination of gain on assets disposals between group companies.

There are basically two methods as explained in Part 2 of this book. The first one consists in booking the gain amount on a Reserves account and the second one on a Deferred income account. It's a group choice but when it has been decided, the group consolidation has to comply with this option.

These consolidation procedures should be written and approved by Auditors. Instead of preparing a thick procedures file including all possible transactions that could happen during the lifetime of the group, we recommend starting such file in a more flexible way. This method consists in adding one new procedure description the first time it happens in the group, after a discussion and approval by Auditors. Maybe, this file will contain only a few procedures at the beginning of the consolidation process but, year after year, this number will certainly increase in a more efficient and cheapest way.

A final comment about this subject concerns the language to use with all group companies.

Whenever that language may be, we recommend using a unique language. The reasons are quite clear. If you start communicate written information in

the language of company 1, be sure company 2, speaking another language, will ask also a translation.
