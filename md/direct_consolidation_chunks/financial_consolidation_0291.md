Adjustment (a) consists in booking the gross value of the leased asset in Assets and the leased capital as a loan in the Liabilities.

Adjustment (b) depreciates the asset value on the basis of a 10 years  \((10%)\)  duration and the corresponding debit is the decreasing of the capital loans by the same amount.

Adjustment (c) consists in a reclassification in the P&L accounts. Services for an amount of 13 are set to zero, 10 being transferred to Depreciation account and 3 to Financial interest charges.

No impact on the result for such journal entries, only reclassifications.
