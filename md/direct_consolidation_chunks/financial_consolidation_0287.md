## The adjustments = Year 2

Again, we first consider the statutory journal entry (3) in company A accounts which is similar to the one seen in Year 2.


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 400 | Capital | 500 |
| (3) | (400) | Reserves | 50 |
| Cash | 150 | Result | 0 |
| (3) | 460 | (3) | 60 |
| Purchases | 400 | Sales/B | 0 |
|   |   | (3) | 460 |
| Stocks var. | (400) | Stocks var. | 0 |
| Result | 0 | (3) | (400) |
| (3) | 60 |   |   |



| B (Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Stocks | 0 | Capital 800 |
|   | (4) 460 | Reserves 0 |
| Cash | 950 | Result 150 |
|   | (4) (460) |   |
| Purchases/A | 0 | Sales/B 500 |
|   | (4) 460 |   |
| Stocks var. | 0 | Stocks var. (350) |
|   | (4) (460) |   |
| Result | 150 |   |


In B accounts, the statutory journal

entry (4) is also similar to the one in Year 1. Of course, in the meantime, the stocks bought last year have been completely sold to  3rd  Parties. As we isolate the situation, we can suppose these stocks have generated a profit of 150.

Let's book now the consolidation adjustments.

No surprise for company A. We find the same consolidation adjustment as the one booked in Year 1, except the stocks margin which is now 60.


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 0 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 50 |   |   |
| (c) | 60 |   |   |
| Cash | 610 | Result | 60 |
| (c) | (60) |   |   |
| Purchases | 400 | Sales/B | 460 |
| (c) | (60) |   |   |
| Stocks var. | (400) | Stocks var. | (400) |
| Result | 60 |   |   |
| (c) | (60) |   |   |



| B (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Stocks | 460 | Capital | 800 |
|   | (b)(d)(e) | (50)Reserves | 0 |
|   |   | (b)(e) | (50) |
| Cash | 490 | Result | 150 |
|   |   | (d) | 50 |
| Purchases/A | 460 | Sales/B | 500 |
|   | (e) | (60) |   |
| Stocks var. | (460) | Stocks var. | (350) |
|   | (e) | 60 | (d) |
| Result | 150 |   |   |
|   | (d) | 50 |   |
