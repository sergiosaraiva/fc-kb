## Merge analysis : The statutory accounts

As shown in the report above, the total equity of both companies A and B is  4000 + 6300  less the 300 dividends, which is equal to the opening equity of company A+B.

Moreover, it is important to notice that

\[
30 % * 4000 + 80 % * 6000 = 1200 + 4800 = 6000 = 60 % * 10000
\]

meaning that the exchange of shares is fair for all shareholders.

And so, shall we get some problems in the next consolidation? Unfortunately yes because if the exchange of shares is 'fair' when considering the statutory equity, it becomes "unfair" in consolidation because there are some adjustments impacting the equity.

We will come back to this problem when considering the Year 2 figures.
