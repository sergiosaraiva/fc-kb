### And finally, do we book translation adjustments in P&L?

When we calculate the net amount impacting P&L and Reserves, two of the three methods explained above do not take into account the translation adjustments. The third method will it comes down to a debit and credit on the same account.

It seems obvious that on the statutory side of the transaction, the negotiation normally takes into account the equity at the date of the transaction, hence includes the translation adjustments. The rationale is not based on the historical value. This also means that the statutory gain on disposal has a component dealing with the translation amounts.

And to get everyone to agree, we would recommend to book the adjustment as we did by booking at least two P&L accounts, one correcting the statutory gain and another one booking an exchange gain or loss.

In all cases, the net impact remains the one we calculated with the help of our three methods.
