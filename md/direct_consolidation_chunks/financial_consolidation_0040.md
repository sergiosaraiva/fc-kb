## Second caleaory example: "Elimination of internal transactions" adjustments

A company A sells to company B an asset, for a price of 120. This asset is booked in company A accounts for a value of 100. Consequently, A shows a group profit of 20 and the asset is suddenly revaluated by 20 in the group accounts.

This transaction leads to a non economical conclusion. Indeed, because of a group transaction, an asset is revaluated and the group profit is increased.

This is a kind of situation that a consolidation office has to detect and to adjust consequently. A good consolidation bundle is necessary.

What is the impact in the consolidation?

In company A accounts, eliminate the group profit that has not been realized with the outside world.

In company B accounts, reverse the statutory depreciation based on an unaccepted value in consolidation, eliminate the profit booked in the acquired asset and depreciate the new value of that asset (same economical life time?).
