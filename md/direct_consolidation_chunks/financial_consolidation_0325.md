Here are Year 1 and Year 2 statutory accounts of company A.

The Year 1 profit we consolidated was 200, but when we receive the Year 2 accounts, we find an opening equity of  1850 = 1000 + 850  while it should have been  1900 = 1000 + 700 + 200 . After investigation, company A confirms there has been a late booking for a provision of 50.
