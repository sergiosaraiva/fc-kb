### What about historical adjustments when company P consolidates?

This question appears quite often in this situation and the answer is supposed to be: Yes, we keep in "group P" all historical adjustments booked in "group A".

Our position towards this question is the opposite.

Company P is a new company deciding for the first time this Year 2 to produce consolidated accounts. Moreover, if we suppose that the family has founded this company P this year, all these historical adjustments as goodwill, tangible assets depreciations, provisions, elimination of group profits, ... have no signification from the point of view of new P company.

Company P is starting a consolidation and all historical adjustments related to 'Group A" consolidation should be ignored.

With this position, we understand that the Bankers are probably a little bit disoriented and ask to maintain a "Group A" consolidation.
