## 4.5 Comparison between the different consolidation methods

In this chapter, we have considered two companies P and S, P owning S with  51% ,  50%  and  49%  successively. For each of these percentages, we have then applied the corresponding consolidation method to statutory accounts which have been maintained identical.

What is the effect of these consolidation methods on the same figures? The answer can be found in the following presentation.


|   | Global integration | Proportional integration | Equity method |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Investments S | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Equity value of S |   |   | 196 |
| Assets | 1,730 | 1,380 | 1,030 |
| Link account | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Total Assets | 1,730 | 1,380 | 1,226 |



|   | Global integration | Proportional integration | Equity method |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Capital | 500 | 500 | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 | 300 | 300 |
| Result | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| Conso. reserves (S) | 84 | 80 | 76 |
| Minority int. | 196 | 0 | 0 |
| Liabilities | 550 | 400 | 250 |
| Total Liabilities | 1,730 | 1,380 | 1,226 |



|   | Global integration | Proportional integration | Equity method |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Income | 1,600 | 1,300 | 1,000 |
| Profit from Equity cies |   |   | 24.5 |
| Expenses | 1,450 | 1,175 | 900 |
| Result | 150 | 125 | 124.5 |
| 3rd Parties result | 24.5 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
| Group result | 125.5 | 125.0 | 124.5 |


We can see that the total of the consolidated balance sheet decreases the same time the group is decreasing its level of control on company C.

The group equity which is equal to the addition of Capital, Reserves, Result and Consolidated reserves would have been the same if the percentage itself

would have remained unchanged. That means the Group equity does not depend on the consolidation method.

Of course, this becomes not true if we take into account the Minority interests which can be considered as equity (not debts!).

In particular, the consolidated reserves of S are showing a difference of 4 which is due to the effect of the percentage variation of  1%  on its equity.

Finally, the contribution of S in the group profit is also decreasing because of the  1% . That means the profit doesn't depend on the consolidation method neither.
