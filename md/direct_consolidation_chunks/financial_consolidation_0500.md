# Chunk 500: 6.3 Let's build a statutory cash flow statement

## Context

This section contains financial statement data. Contains formula: md ========== -->.

## Content

An important validation between flows and P&L accounts must be done for "Depreciations", "Provisions" and "Gain on disposals". If the amounts booked on flows and on the corresponding P&L accounts are different, there will be an error in the cash flow statement.

<!-- ========== CHUNK 21: DOC0038_pages_21_251127_155959.md ========== -->

But how are we able to see this kind of error? We said in the previous section that the net cash calculated in the cash flow statement had to be equal to the net variation of Cash and Cash equivalent accounts deduced from the balance sheet. That's what we mean by an error.

The problem is when such error occurs, it is rather difficult to identify its origin.

We now consider the cash flow statement deduced from these figures, with some additional comments.


| Result | 400 |
| --- | ---: |
| Depreciations | 600 |
| Provisions | 400 |
| Gain on disposals | (200) |
| Cash flow | 1,200 |
| Var. Receivables | (400) |
| Var. Payables | 900 |
| Working capital | 500 |
| Cash from operating activities | 1,700 |


We start with the profit of 400 and adjust it by eliminating non cash expenses and non cash income. This gives the cash flow.

The net variation of current assets and liabilities is the working capital.

Addition of both gives the cash from operating activities.


| Investments |   |
| --- | ---: |
| Tangible assets | (3,000) |
| Financial invest. | (800) |
| Disinvestments |   |
| Tangible assets | 1,200 |
| Financial invest. | 300 |
| Cash from Inv./Disinv. | (2,300) |


Investments are negative amounts and presented separately from the disinvestments.


| Capital increase | 1,000 |
| --- | ---: |
| Loans reimbursement | (500) |
| Dividends | (200) |
| Cash from financial activities | 300 |
|   |  |
| Net cash variation | (300) |


These are the financial transactions of the period.

If we go back to the assets above, we will notice that the net variation of the Cash amount is (300) corresponding to the net cash variation calculated in the cash flow statement.

At this stage, we can say that the cash flow statement is technically correct, but it would still need some more investigations on the content of accounts and flows. This is the job of the Auditors and if they make some remarks, this

cash flow statement would be modified only by reclassifications of amounts between lines.

In a certain way, we would perform an accounting process by debiting and crediting flows as we usually do it for accounts!
