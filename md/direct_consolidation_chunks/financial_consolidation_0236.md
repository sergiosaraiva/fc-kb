## 6.2 Currency translation of a balance sheet and a P&L

In this section, we will explain how to translate into consolidation currency a balance sheet and a P&L of a company presenting its statutory accounts in a certain local currency CUR for Year 1 and Year 2.

But before starting this process, let us make some remarks.

We will notice these accounts are presented before appropriation. The profit of Year 1 of 300 in P&L is found on a profit account in equity. We keep the same presentation for the profit of 400 in Year 2.


|   | (CUR) |  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 | Year 2 |   |
| Assets | 5,000 | 5,700 |
|   | 5,000 | 5,700 |


It is also important to see that the capital of 3.500 remains unchanged from Year 1 to Year 2.


| Capital Reserves |   |   |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Liabilities | 1200 | 1500 |
|   | 5,000 | 5,700 |


Moreover, this company doesn't pay any dividends on the basis of the profit of 300 because we can find back this amount in the reserves next year.


| Income | 2,500 | 3,000 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Expenses | 2,200 | 2,600 |
| Profit | 300 | 400 |


Finally, we are aware that the number of accounts is quite reduced, but it is sufficient to explain fully the translation process.

We will first start to translate Year 1 accounts by applying the principle of the closing rate (1 CUR = 2 EUR) for each balance sheet account and the average rate (1 CUR = 2.1 EUR) for the P&L. This translation appears in column (1).


|   | (CUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) | (EUR) |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Year 1 | (1) | (2) | (3) |   |
| Assets | 5,000 | 10,000 |   | 10,000 |
|   | 5,000 | 10,000 | 0 | 10,000 |



| Capital | 3,500 | 7,000 |   | 7,000 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Reserves | 0 | 0 |   | 0 |
| Profit | 300 | 600 | 30 | 630 |
| Translation adjustments |   |   | (30) | (30) |
| Liabilities | 1,200 | 2,400 |   | 2,400 |
|   | 5,000 | 10,000 | 0 | 10,000 |



| Income | 2,500 | 5,250 |   | 5,250 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Expenses | 2,200 | 4,620 |   | 4,620 |
| Profit | 300 | 630 | 0 | 630 |
