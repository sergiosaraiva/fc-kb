### Answer 3.08

We first have to evaluate the consolidated equity of the subgroup which is

Capital of company  A = 3000  
Reserves of company A = 2000  
Result of company  A = 1000  
- Consolidated reserves of company B = 420 = 70% * [2000 + 500 + 100] - [1500 + (100)]

that is a total of 6420.

Considering a selling price of  X , company  P  would make a profit of  X - 60% * 6420 = X - 3852 .

But this profit has to be decreased by the 500 goodwill attached to the  60%  shares, which gives a final profit of X - 3852 - 500 that must be equal to 300.

We find  X = 4652
