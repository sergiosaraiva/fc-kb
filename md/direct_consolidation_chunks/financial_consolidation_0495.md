### Cash from operating activities

This category shows the cash related to the ongoing business and is usually presented under two different methods: the direct method or the indirect method.

#### The direct method presentation

Let's say immediately that this method is supported by few groups only, besides the fact that it is a recommendation of the IFRS rules. The reason for this is the difficulty to capture the input information.

Following this method, the following information is supposed to be provided

Cash received from customers

Cash paid to suppliers  
Cash paid to employees  
Financial interests paid/received  
Tax and VAT paid/paid back

and we understand that most accounting systems make it difficult to pick up payments, certainly for customers and suppliers, because there are all mixed up with other financial transactions on different bank accounts.

The indirect method avoids such a difficulty and explains its success.

The indirect method presentation

We have two main sub-categories: the cash flow and the working capital.

The cash flow

We start by considering the company result which consists in income and expenses, both cash and non cash. The idea is then to evaluate the cash part of that result by reversing all non cash income and expenses.

Without giving the most general and complete definition, cash flow could be defined as follows

Result of the period  
+Non cash expenses

Depreciations  
+ Use of provisions  
+Write-off  
+ Exchange losses (unrealized)  
Losses on assets disposals  
+Deferred taxes (charges)  
o +...

- Non cash income

- Reverse of depreciations  
- Reverse of provisions  
Write-back  
- Exchange gains (unrealized)  
Gains on assets disposals  
Deferred taxes (income)  
0 -...

The total of all these items gives what is called the cash flow.

#### The working capital

This sub-category contains the net variation of current receivables and current payables.

From a cash point of view, if payables variation is a decrease (negative amount), this variation will appear with a negative sign in the cash flow statement because it represents a cash out.

The opposite must be said for a decrease of receivables, so also a negative amount, with a positive impact in the cash flow statement because it represents cash received from customers.

Cash flow and working capital added together give the "Cash from operating activities".
