## Validations of variations between opening and closina amounts

If the group has decided to produce a consolidated cash flow statement, flows must be defined on every balance sheet account. This implies to validate that "opening value + total of flow amounts = closing value".

These validations must also be extended to accounts with partners.

Special care has to be brought to the following situation.


|   | Total | Partner B | Consolidated |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Opening value | 100 | 50 | 50 |
| Increase | 30 | 40 | (10) |
| Decrease | (10) |   | (10) |
| Closing value | 120 | 90 | 30 |


We consider company A reporting its receivables account. The "Total" column represents the evolution of the total balance sheet account between opening and closing, including intercompany amounts with the partner B.

In addition to this information, there must be similar information concerning each partner, as shown here for partner B.

This situation gives a problem after the elimination process because we remain in particular with a negative increase of (10), thanks to the fact that the intercompany increase is higher than the balance (group +  3^{rd}  Parties) increase.

This is something to validate for every intercompany account in the balance sheet.
