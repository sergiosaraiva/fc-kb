This Part 4 analyzes situations that don't occur each year in the consolidation of a group. However, from time to time, they really happen and then they are sometimes rather difficult to solve.

Moreover, the situation is sometimes getting more complex by the fact that several events are combined together.

The situations we analyze in this Part 4 are kept separate in order to give a complete and clear solution for each one.

If more than one event happens during the same consolidation period, we recommend solving them sequentially.

For each individual situation, it is sometimes worth extracting the case from the reality of the group and transforming it into a "school-case" with easier figures, simple percentages (without decimals) and a limited number of accounts. Most of the time, solving the case within one consolidation period will not guarantee the solution. The experience shows that it is much more useful to first consolidate a situation before the particular transaction and then to consolidate just after the transaction by justifying both the Equity and the Minority interests evolutions. A cash flow statement can also be useful in some situations.

That's the methodology we will adopt for most of the cases analyzed in this Part 4.
