## The adjustments - Year 3

This Year 3 is the final year for this transaction and we present here below the consolidation adjustments without any comments because it is quite obvious.

One can see that statutory net value of R&D is zero as required in consolidation.

Deferred tax assets are also equal to zero.


| A (Year 3) |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R&D (Acq. Value) | 120 | Capital | 500 |
|   | (b) | (120) |   |
| R&D (Deprec.) | (120) | Reserves | 224 |
|   | (a) | 120 | (a) |
|   |   |   | (b) |
| Deferred tax |   | Result | 112 |
|   | (a) | (36) | (a) |
|   | (b) | 36 |   |
| Cash | 884 | Tax payables | 48 |
| Purchases | 700 | Sales | 900 |
| Depreciation | 40 |   |   |
| Tax (Real) | 48 |   |   |
| Tax (Deferred) | (a) | (40) |   |
| (a) | 12 |   |   |
| Result | 112 |   |   |
|   | (a) | 28 |   |


In Year 4, everything will be set to zero in statutory and no consolidation adjustments have to be carried forward any more.

Let's conclude this case study by comparing the effective tax amounts really paid during these three years and the total tax adjusted by our adjustments during that same period.


|   | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Tax paid | 48 | 48 | 48 | 144 |
| Tax paid and deferred | 24 | 60 | 60 | 144 |


This report gives two messages:

- The total tax paid is 144 and the adjusted tax over these three periods is also 144  
- The second line shows which amount of tax the company A would have paid by applying the group rules in its statutory accounts.

Annual amounts are different but both totals are equal over the three years.

And our final conclusion will be to say that not all consolidation adjustments require calculation of a deferred tax effect. Most of the time, depreciation adjustment implies a deferred tax, depreciations and impairments on consolidation goodwill and elimination of dividends never imply a deferred tax effect.
