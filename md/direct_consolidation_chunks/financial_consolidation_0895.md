multi analytical dimensions to consolidate as required by some IFRS notes to the accounts.

And finally, the most frequent situation happening is when the person having developed so many complex macro leaves the company.

Here comes the time where Auditors are becoming worried.

In most countries, and particularly in European states, the consolidation process must rely on an accounting approach, with general ledger, balance, journals, booking entries, ... reports which discards definitely the spreadsheet approach.

The standard accountina software family

It must be accepted that most of these software are really not consolidating figures but just adding them.

All calculation as currency translations, minority interests, equity eliminations, equity values, proportional methods, ... have to be prepared manually and keyed in the accounting software.

But we must admit this time we are in an accounting approach.

The consolidation software family, based on a mana element reportina system

Such software category has originally been developed to solve reporting problems and quite often they contain a few general consolidation features as intercompany reconciliation and some standard eliminations.

Most of all other specialised features are just not developed as imbedded functions and it is the user job to parameterize these functions, when it is possible and with the help of consultants.

Of course, if such consolidation functions are developed in a satisfactory way, when working with this family of software, it becomes easier to reconcile figures between statutory consolidation and reporting.

If such software also includes efficient reporting facilities, then our opinion is that this software family brings the most accurate and efficient solution.
