| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A | (a) 400 | Capital | 1,000 |
| (b) (160) | Reserves | 500 |   |
| Fin. Inv./A | 2,000 | Result | (b) (80) |
| Fin. Inv./B | 800 | Result | 200 |
| Other assets | 2,200 | (b) (80) | 3,300 |
| A |  |  |  |
| Other assets | 6,000 | Capital | 3,000 |
| Reserves | 1,500 |   |   |
| Result | 500 |   |   |
| Other liabilities | 1,000 |   |   |
| B |  |  |  |

| Reserves | 400 |   |   |
| Result | 500 |   |   |
| Other liabilities | 1,100 |   |   |


Adjustment (a): Gross goodwill at acquisition time, on year ago

Adjustment (b): Depreciations of this goodwill, with the first  20%  booked on the Reserves account, corresponding to Year 0 and  20%  booked on the P&L for this Year 1.

Consolidated accounts present no difficulties


|   | P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 240 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 420 |   |   |
| Result | 120 |   |   |
| Equity value (A) | 1,500 | Conso. Res.(A) | (100) |
| Conso. Res.(B) | 720 |   |   |
| Minority int.(B) | 380 |   |   |
| Other assets | 5,200 | Other liabilities | 4,400 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (100) = 30% * [3000 + 1500 + 500] - [2000 + (400)]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = 720 = 80% * [1000 + 400 + 500] - 800  
Minority interests (B)  = 380 = 20%  \* [1000 + 400 + 500]  
Equity value (A)  = 1500 = 30%  [3000 + 1500 + 500]
