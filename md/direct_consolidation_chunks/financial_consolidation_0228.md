## Context

## Content

## Advantages:
- Single-step consolidation process
- Simplified calculation methodology
- Works even with crossed participations
- Reduces complexity in reporting


Of course, this transformation brings a new difficulty: the calculation of indirect financial percentages sometimes in quite complex structures, which could include crossed participations. We will come back to that subject at the end of this chapter.

For the moment, we just associate to each company its indirect financial percentage which is  80%  for A and  56% = 80% * 70%  for B.

We consider the same balance sheets as above but this time we produce the final consolidated balance sheet of our example in a single process.


| P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 150 |
|   | Result | 30 |
|   | Conso. Res. (A) | 144 |
|   | Conso. Res. (B) | 9.6 |
|   | Minor. Inter. (A) | 56 |
|   | Minor. Inter. (B) | 70.4 |
| Assets | Liabilities | 440 |
| Total | 1,400 | 1,400 |
