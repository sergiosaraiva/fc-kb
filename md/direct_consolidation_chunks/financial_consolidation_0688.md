- Foreign currency subsidiary (CUR)
- Majority ownership (60%)
- Simple parent-subsidiary relationship


We are considering a company A whose accounts are in a foreign currency CUR. This company is owned by the parent company P at  80%  during Year 1. On January  1st  Year 2,  20%  of these shares are disposed to  3rd  Parties for a price of 900.

Company A has been acquired during Year -1, so two years ago, with a goodwill of 400, after allocation on some tangible fixed assets for a gross

amount of 100 CUR. That allocation is depreciated by  10%  per year. Since Year 0, a total of 200 impairments has been booked and we will assume that during Year 1 and Year 2 there will be no additional impairments.

The scenario of this case study consists in

- Consolidate Year 1  
- Analyze the impact of these  20%  disposal of shares  
- Consolidate Year 2  
- Justify the evolution of consolidated reserves, minority interests and currency translation adjustments

and finally answer to the above question.
