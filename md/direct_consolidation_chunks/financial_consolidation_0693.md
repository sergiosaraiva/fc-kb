## Consolidation = Year 2

Here are the statutory accounts of Year 2


|   |  | p |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill |  | Capital | 5,000 |
| Reserves | 4,000 |   |   |
| (b)(e) | (150)654 |   |   |
| Fin. Inv./A |  | Result | 600 |
| (e) | (654) |   |   |
| Other assets |  | Other liabilities | 3,400 |
| A (C)UR |  |  |  |
| Tangible assets |  | Capital | 200 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| (c)(d) | 100(30) |   |   |
| Other assets |  | Result(d) | 200(10) |
| Other liabilities | 800 |   |   |


where we see that the financial investment on A in P accounts is now 1500 instead of 2000, reflecting the transaction we just analyzed.

Adjustment (a): Initial goodwill of 400 reduced by one quarter, so 300.

Adjustment (b): Total impairments also reduced by one quarter

Adjustment (c): Gross amount of goodwill allocation for 100 CUR on fixed tangible assets. This amount reflects an economical value and it wouldn't make any sense to reduce it also by one quarter. An economical value cannot depend on a percentage of participation.

Adjustment (d): Depreciation of that goodwill allocation, so  4*10%  of 100 CUR corresponding to the periods Year -1 to Year 2. An amount of (30) CUR is booked on the Reserves and (10) CUR on the P&L.

Adjustment (e): This is the adjustment resulting from our analysis of the transaction.
