## Consolidation - Year 2

We propose to take knowledge of Year 2 statutory accounts, which includes only one consolidation adjustment related to the disposal of  40%  of shares of company A.

This time, we will also consolidate the P&L


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 200 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 1,000 |   |   |
| (a) | 224 |   |   |
| Result | 300 |   |   |
| (a) | (224) |   |   |
| Other assets | 4,800 | Other liabilities | 2,700 |
| P |  |  |  |
| Cost of sales | 4,700 | Sales | 4,300 |
| Result | 300 | Gain on disposal | 700 |
|   | (a) | (a) | (224) |


In its statutory accounts, company P sells the  40 % shares of company A for a price of 900 and for a book value of 200, making a gain of 700 as we can see in the P&L above.

In consolidation, we know we have to compare the 900 with  40%  of the equity on July  1st  Year 2. At that date, company A makes a profit of 60 so we get  424 = 40% * [500 + 400 + 100 + 60]  and a gain on disposal equal to  476 = 900 - 424 .

The statutory gain has to be reduced by 224 to make it equal to the consolidation gain of 476. That's the role of adjustment (a).

We are now going to consolidate company A with the equity method without booking any adjustment in the following statutory accounts.


| A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 500 |
|   | Result | 100 |
| Other assets | 4,000 | Other liabilities |
|   |   | 2,900 |



| A (December 31 Year 2) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Cost of sales | 8,900 | Sales |
| Result (Group) | 100 |   |


Here are the consolidated balance sheet and P&L


|   | P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Equity value (A) | 440 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 1,224 |   |   |
| Result | 76 |   |   |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 240 |   |   |
| Other assets | 4,800 | Other liabilities | 2,700 |



| Cost of sales | 4,700 | Sales | 4,300 |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Gain on disposal | 476 |   |   |
| Result | 116 | Profit EM | 40 |


With

- Consolidated reserves (A)  = 240 = 40% * [500 + 500 + 100] - 200  Equity value (A)  = 440 = 40% * [500 + 500 + 100]
