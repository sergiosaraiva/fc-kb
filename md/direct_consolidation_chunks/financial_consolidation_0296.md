## The adjustments - Year 2

Receiving Year 2 statutory accounts, R&D have been depreciated twice. In consolidation, we have to carry forward Year 1 adjustments and book an appropriate adjustment for Year 2.

Here are the accounts after consolidation adjustments.


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| R&D (Acq. Value) | 120(b)(120) | Capital | 500 |
| R&D (Deprec.) | (80)(a) | Reserves | 112 |
| (a) | 28 |   |   |
| (b) | (84) |   |   |
| Deferred tax | (a)(24) | Result | 112 |
| (b)36 | 28 |   |   |
| Cash | 732 | Tax payables | 48 |
| Purchases | 700 | Sales | 900 |
| Depreciation | 40 |   |   |
| Tax (Real) | 48 |   |   |
| Tax (Deferred) | (a)12 |   |   |
| Result | 112 |   |   |
| (a] | 28 |   |   |


Adjustment (a) reverses two depreciations for a total of 80, one amount of 40 is the carry forward of Year 1 and impacts the Reserves and the other one impacts the P&L because related to Year 2. For each of these depreciations, we take care of a deferred tax effect of  30% .

Adjustment (b) is just the carry forward of adjustment (b) of Year 1.

Here is the corresponding tax proof comparing statutory and adjusted figures


| Tax roof Year 2 | Statuto | Consolidation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Profit before tax |   |   |
| Tax (Real) |   |   |
| Tax Deferred |   |   |
| Calculated tax rate | 30% | 30% |


where we find hopefully the same tax rate again.
