# DELTA - Column (3)

By processing like this way, we introduce some mistakes because

- The capital amount should be translated with the historical rate of 0.9 instead of the closing rate, which gives an adjustment of  800 = [0.9 - 0.81 * 8000]  
- The retained earnings amount should be translated with the historical rate of 0.85 instead of the closing rate, which gives an adjustment of  200 = [0.85 - 0.81 * 4000]  
- The result amount has to be translated with the average rate of 0.7 instead of the closing rate, which gives an adjustment of (60) = [0.7 - 0.81 * 600

This leads to the following adjustment.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Capital |   | 800 |
| Retained earnings |   | 200 |
| Result | 60 |   |
| Translation adjustments | 940 |   |
