### Situation before capital increase = Year 1

Company A has been founded by company P a few years ago. Its capital is represented by 100 shares. Here are the statutory accounts of these companies.


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./A | 140 | Capital | 500 |
| Reserves | 300 |   |   |
| Result | 50 |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,360 | Other liabilities | 650 |
| A |  |  |  |
|   |   | Capital | 200 |
|   |   | Retained earn. | (100) |
|   |   | Result | (20) |
| Other assets | 500 | Other liabilities | 420 |


We notice that the equity of A becomes bad. Normally, P should book a write-off on its participation but, in order to keep things simple, we will ignore it. Anyway, in consolidation, such write-off will be reversed.

Consolidated figures are presented below


| P + A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 300 |
|   | Result | 50 |
|   | Conso. Res.(A) | (84) |
|   | Minority int.(A) | 24 |
| Other assets | 1,860 | Other liabilities |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (84) = 70% [200 + (100) + (20)] -140  
Minority interests  = 24 = 30%  \* [200 + (100) + (20)]
