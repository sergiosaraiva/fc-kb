## Justification of consolidated reserves evolution

One difficult issue while processing a consolation is to validate that equity, and in particular group reserves, can be justified just like in a normal accounting approach: opening reserves  +  profit - dividends = closing reserves.

That's what we are going to check by using the following appropriate report.


|   | Year 1 Reserves | Year 2 Result | Divid. (-) paid | Divid. (+) | P Approp. | Year 2 Reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Company P | 130 | 37 |   | 8 | (15) | 160 |
| Company A | 56 | 24 | (8) |   |   | 72 |
|   | 186 | 61 | (8) | 8 | (15) | 232 |


The number of lines of this report is the number of companies in the consolidation scope.

Column (1) contains the contribution of each company in the Year 1 consolidated reserves.

Column (2) shows the same for the individual result of each company, taking into account that the profit shown is the group profit  \((24 = 80% * 30)\) .

Column (3) shows the group part of dividends paid by each company (A pays a group dividend of 8)

Column (4) shows the part of dividends received from group companies (P receive a group dividends of 8)

Column (5) shows the dividends paid by the parent company to its shareholders. Obviously there can be an amount only on the P line of this report.

Column (6) is similar to Column (1), but for Year 2

At this stage, we make the following checks:

- The total of dividends paid must be equal to the total of dividends received. We recommend to use two columns because one can easily see which company is paying a dividend and which companies are receiving dividends. A single column would be more ambiguous.  
- The total line must show that opening reserves + result - P dividends = closing reserves  
- And if that total line is correct, then we recommend to check that opening reserves + result - dividends paid + dividends received = closing reserves

When these three checks have been validated, there is a good probability that the consolidated equity is correct.
