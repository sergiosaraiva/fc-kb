### The statutory accounts

We can see that parent company  P  is paying dividends of 100 at the end of Year 1 and Year 2.


|   | Parent company P |  |  | Company A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |   |
| Capital | 1,000 | 1,000 | 1,000 | 2,000 | 2,000 | 2,000 |
| Reserves | 800 | 900 | 1,000 | 0 | (100) | 30 |
| Result | 200 | 200 | 300 | (100) | 300 | 150 |


At the end of Year 1, company A makes a loss and, of course, the ordinary shares will give no dividends.

For the privileged shares, on the contrary, company A has no choice: a dividend of 50 must be paid to the shareholders. However, its cash situation being bad, these dividends will be paid at the end of Year 2 if the situation improves in the meantime.

At the end of Year 2, company A is able to pay the 50 related to Year 1 and the dividends of 50 related to Year 2, both concerning the privileged shares. Moreover, A decides also to pay a dividend of 0.07 per ordinary shares, so 14 = 0.07 * 200 to A and 56 = 0.07 * 800 to the  3^{rd}  Parties.

The financial investment on company A in parent company P accounts can be deducted from the above information as  1200 = 200  ordinary shares of value  1 + 1000  privileged shares of value 1.
