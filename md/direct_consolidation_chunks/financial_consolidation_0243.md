## 6.5 How to manage historical rates on the equity accounts?

When translating the balance sheet, we have seen that the equity has to be translated at historical rate in order to avoid some problems in justifying evolution of consolidated reserves.

Year after year, this situation is becoming more and more difficult to manage all these currency rates and the purpose of this section consists in explaining one best practice.

We will consider a capital account of a foreign company from Year 1 to Year 4, with the following assumptions

- In Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3, the capital amount remains unchanged, except the closing rate of each year which changes  
In Year 4, we suppose a capital increase happening during the year.

What follows explains how to manage the translation adjustments in order to keep things auditable for every one.

We consider a capital of 100 CUR from Year 1 to Year 3.


|   | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Capital in local currency | 100 | 100 | 100 | 120 |
| Historical rate | 1.6 |   |   |   |
| Closing rate | 1.5 | 1.7 | 1.8 | 1.4 |
| Capital at historical rate | 160 | 160 | 160 | 191 |
| Capital at closing rate | 150 | 170 | 180 | 168 |


The historical rate for this capital is 1.6. Of course, closing rate is changing as shown here above.

A certain day of Year 4, there is a capital increase of 20 CUR and the currency rate that day is 1.55 giving a valuation of that capital increase for  31 = 20 \times 1.55 .

The main idea for historical rate is to keep track of translations adjustments instead of historical currency rates, as explained hereunder


| Adjustment of capital | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Year 1 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Year 2 |   | (20) | (20) | (20) |
| Year 3 |   |   | (10) | (10) |
| Year 4 |   |   |   | 40 |
| Year 4 |   |   |   | 3 |
| Capital after adjustments | 160 | 160 | 160 | 191 |



| Translation adjustments | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Year 1 | (10) | (10) | (10) | (10) |
| Year 2 |   | 20 | 20 | 20 |
| Year 3 |   |   | 10 | 10 |
| Year 4 |   |   |   | (40) |
| Year 4 |   |   |   | (3) |
|   | (10) | 10 | 20 | (23) |
