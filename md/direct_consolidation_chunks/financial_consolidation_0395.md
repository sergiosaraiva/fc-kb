## Reserves

The evolution of this item should be justified only by the group result and the parent company dividends paid to the shareholders.

However, let's go back to the detailed content of this account.

It includes all reserves accounts of the parent company (legal reserves, other reserves, retained earnings, result of the period) and the consolidated reserves of each company belonging to the consolidation scope, whatever consolidation method we apply to each.

Consolidated reserves have been explained in Part 2 Chapter 4 and we just recall here the formal definition

\[
% (C)^{*}Equity - % (S)^{*}Financial Investment
\]

where  \(% (\mathsf{C})\)  means indirect financial percentage owned in company C and  \(% (\mathsf{S})\)  means indirect percentage owned in shareholder S of C. There may be more than one shareholder.

Looking at this definition, it is easy to understand that as soon as the percentages are changing from Year 1 to Year 2, whatever the reason is, it becomes doubtful that the evolution will be justified easily.

Moreover, supposing there is no change in the percentages, Equity and Financial investment may also change.

It is also important to keep in mind that these accounts also include consolidation adjustments, not only of the period, but also from the previous periods (historical adjustments).

For all these reasons, we will analyze more in details that Reserves account in the next section and will conclude to the necessity of applying some methodology.
