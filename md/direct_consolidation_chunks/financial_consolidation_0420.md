## Key Observations:
- Significant increase in A's stake in B
- Capital increase in B matches investment increase
- Despite lower profitability, equity grew through capital injection


The consolidated reserves of B for each year are equal to

480 = 48% * [1000 + 800 + 200] - 80% * 600 for Year 1  
-  {548} = 56%  * \left\lbrack  {{1500} + {950} + {100}}\right\rbrack  - {80}%  * {1100}  for Year 2

giving a variation of  68 = 548 - 480  which consists in the following components,

-  56 = 56%  * 100 corresponding to the group part of the result  
(24)  = 48%  (50) corresponding to the group part of the dividend  
-  156 = 8%  * 1950 which is a good illustration of the discontinuing process of consolidation. Between the instant "before/after" the increase in capital, the indirect percentage is suddenly increased by  8%  acting in the opening equity, not included the capital increase  
-  280 = 80%  [70% 500] which is the net part of the capital increase belonging to the group  
(400) = 80% (* (500) corresponding to the group part of the capital increase.

If we find again the group result and the group dividends, there are three other components impacting the reserves and which cannot be kept as such.

The net amount of  36 = 156 + 280 - 400  has to be considered as a badwill because by this transaction, the group has gained some reserves.

Depending on consolidation rules (IFRS/Local Gaap), we have to book a consolidation adjustment for this amount and to transfer it to the appropriate account.

In order to finalize this step, let's suppose we are consolidating under IFRS rules. Here is the adjustment we would book in company A accounts.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fin. Inv./B | 45 |   |
| Badwill profit |   | 45 |


But why 45 instead of 36? Because 36 has been calculated as a net group amount. By booking this amount in company A, owned at

80% , we would calculate  28.8 = 80%  of 36 instead of 36. Another way to book this adjustment would be to use the amount of 36 but to define the adjustment as impacting the group account at  100% . It is a choice. We recommend booking the amount of 45.

So, consolidated reserves of B have to be recalculated

\[
512 = 56 % ^ {*} [ 1500 + 950 + 100 ] - 80 % ^ {*} [ 1100 + \underline {45} ] \text {for Year 2}
\]

giving a difference of 32 with Year 1, which again is equal to 56 (the group result) minus 24 (the group dividends).

Finally, we remain again with these two expected components.
