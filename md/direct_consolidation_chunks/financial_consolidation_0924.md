## Validations on accounts with partners

The book value of financial investments accounts in the balance sheet must be equal to the total of the contribution given by companies owned. All other non consolidated amounts should be booked on another account.

The reason for this approach is rather simple. Financial investments on consolidated companies are translated at historical rate while other financial investments remain at closing rate.

For intercompany accounts, a validation should be done on the total of contributed amounts which should be less or equal to the net balance account. If the net balance account includes only transactions with partners, which is our recommendation, then validation would be made only on the equality.
