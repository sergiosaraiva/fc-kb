### Consolidated reserves evolution


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends | Dividends + | Transfers | Dividends P | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| P | 1,300 | 200 |   |   |   |   | 1,500 |
| A | 800 | 90 |   |   | 66 |   | 956 |
| B | 66 | 0 |   |   | (66) |   | 0 |
|   | 2,166 | 290 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2,456 |


In Year 1 there are three companies and only two for Year 2. Reserves of company B are just transferred to the reserves of company A.

This case study may look a little bit difficult to solve but, if done correctly, the reserves evolution gives a very clear and comprehensive picture.
