# Chunk 677: Consolidation = Year 2

## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Contains formula: company P has made a gain of  300 = 1300  (selling price) - 1000 (shares value in statutory accounts.

## Content

Adjustment (g): This adjustment concerns the disposal of the  50%  shares of company A and requires some explanations.

In statutory accounts, company P has made a gain of  300 = 1300  (selling price) - 1000 (shares value in statutory accounts).

In consolidation, the gain is calculated as the difference between that selling price and the group part of consolidated equity disposed. Moreover, we also have to consider as an expense the part of the goodwill attached to these shares, so  \(108 = 50% * [360 + (144)]\) .
