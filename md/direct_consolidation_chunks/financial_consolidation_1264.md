### Answer 2.05

Option a: Not correct

We can have a company owned at  100%  giving negative consolidated reserves and a single company with  3rd  Parties with a positive equity, so giving positive Minority interests.

Option b: Correct

... and the cumulated losses are greater than the consolidated reserves of all the other companies of the group.

Option c: Not correct

In consolidation, reserves can be negative because one company makes huge cumulative losses since a number of years.

Option d: Not correct

Suppose parent company reserves are equal to zero and the only consolidated company is making losses since its first year consolidation. In such case we would get consolidated equity lower than statutory equity.
