# 1 EVOLUTION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACCOUNTS

Justifying the evolution of consolidated financial statements between two periods can sometimes turn to a challenge.

In a classical accounting system, a period is closed and all balance sheet accounts are carried forward to the next period as opening amounts.

In a consolidation process, this is not so easy for the following reasons

- Accounts received from a company for the last period are not always the final ones  
- Currency rates used in consolidation are changing between two periods  
- Some financial percentages may also change between two periods, implying at least some difficulties at the Equity level  
- If the change in percentage becomes material for a certain company, its consolidation method may also change  
- Historical adjustments booked in former consolidations still remain active in current consolidation. Not carrying forward one of these adjustments in current consolidation may give some trouble...

All these situations are at the origin of what is called a discontinuing problem in consolidation. We have to deal with it while the evolution of consolidated figures represents the most important part of the consolidated disclosures to provide.
