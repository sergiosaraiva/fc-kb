# Chunk 207: Explanations

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Contains formula: Consolidated reserves on B = 12 = 70% * [100 + 50 + 10] - 100. Includes practical examples. Shows detailed calculations.

## Explanations

In step 1, we consolidate B with the global integration method in A and with a percentage of  70% :

The Capital, the Reserves and the Result come from company A  
- Consolidated reserves on B = 12 = 70% * [100 + 50 + 10] - 100

Minority interests on B = 48 = 30% * [100+50+10]  
- **Assets and Liabilities accounts come from the addition of A and B for 100%**.

Here is the consolidated balance sheet of A+B


| A + B |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 200 |
|   | Reserves | 150 |
|   | Result | 30 |
|   | Conso. Res. (B) | 12 |
|   | Minor. Inter. (B) | 48 |
| Assets | 760 | Liabilities |
| Total | 760 | Total |


In step 2, we consolidate, by global integration, the  A + B  level in company P:

The Capital, the Reserves and the Result come from company P  
- Consolidated reserves of A+B = 153.6 = 80% * [200+150+30+12] - 160  
Minority interests on A+B = 126.4 = 20%  \star  [200+150+30+12] + 48  
- Assets and Liabilities accounts come from the addition of P and A+B at  100% .

Here is the final consolidated balance sheet for this group.


| P + (A + B) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 500 |
|   | Reserves | 150 |
|   | Result | 30 |
|   | Conso. Res (A+B) | 153.6 |
|   | Minor. Inter. (A+B) | 126.4 |
| Assets | Liabilities | 440 |
| Total | 1,400 | 1,400 |


We notice that the consolidated reserves calculated for B at the first level are considered as an equity account on which we apply the  80% .

On the Minority interests side, the 48 calculated on the first level have to be added at  100%  to the calculation of Minority interests in the next level.

Moreover, the  20%  Minority interests at the final level also applies on the equity of  \mathsf{A} + \mathsf{B} , including the 12 consolidated reserves of B.

Is this consolidation technique efficient in any group structure?

If we suppose a larger group with a simple tree structure, the answer would be yes because we could consolidate the whole group starting at the bottom and consider two companies at a time. We would finally reach the top parent company after making a certain number of consolidations of two companies each time.

Nevertheless, some problems could arise if, for instance, the group structure is the following.
