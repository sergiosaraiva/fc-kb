## Be sure to aet some assistance from expert consultant

For a group having an oversized consolidation team with a high level of expertise it makes no sense for one or two consolidations a year. It is much more efficient to manage a reasonable number of persons having a strong knowledge of all group companies and all events related to them. Of course these few people must also have a rather good knowledge of consolidation techniques.

This is a minimum.

Now, these persons can leave the company, can be temporarily ill or just be faced to some difficult consolidation problems. The wise situation in order to avoid planning delay is to be able to count on the assistance of an external expert consultant, in such situations.

This is also a way to secure the planning.
