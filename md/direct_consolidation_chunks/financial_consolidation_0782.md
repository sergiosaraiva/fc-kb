### Let's consider an example.

Until end of Year 1, parent company P was consolidating company A owned at  100% . Financial investment in P is 800 and company A total equity is 1000.

For the last consolidation of A, we have calculated its consolidated reserves as

\[
200 = 100% * 1000 - 800
\]

At the end of Year 2, company A being deconsolidated since the beginning of the year, we find a financial asset in the consolidated accounts equal to  1000 = 100% * 1000 .

To convert this equity value to the historical book value, the write-off amount would be (200) with an impact in P&L the first year.
