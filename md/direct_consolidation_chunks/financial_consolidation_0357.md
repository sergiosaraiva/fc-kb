## Some methodoloav principles

By working in this way, we can point out some important principles

Each consolidation adjustment consists in a journal entry with debits and credits, just like in an accounting system.  
- When receiving the local currency balance sheet of a company, via the consolidation reporting, the result coming from the P&L is equal to the result account in the equity. We can see that this principle applies also to each individual consolidation adjustment.  
- Some transactions need to book adjustments in two (or more) companies. We have seen such situations when eliminating group profit based on an asset disposal or when eliminating the stocks margins. In such case, each adjustment is fully booked in balance in each company. We don't accept to debit one company and credit another company.  
- We also recommend not booking all the adjustments in a kind of "group" company because we loose the benefit of getting a contribution. Moreover, most of the time, it could just be wrong because this dummy company would probably be defined with a financial percentage of  100%  while the concerned companies would have different percentages.

- When booking consolidation adjustments in a foreign company, it should be done in local currency. Of course, in our spreadsheet approach, this adjustment would finally be in the consolidation currency, but after a correct translation as explained in Chapter 6.

We are now going to explain how to produce the eliminations adjustments and you will see that the process is made in respect of the principles just stated above.
