In Year 1, only company B was concerned with Minority interests and in Year 2 only company A+B.

Let's analyze these columns.

Dividends: It shows the amount of dividends paid to  3rd  Parties, that is  20%  * 300

Transfer: This column just consists in transferring Minority interests from company B to company A+B

%  var 1: This amount corresponds to  20% = 40% - 20%  of new Minority interests in the company B equity brought to company A+B, excluding dividends for 300, that is  \(1360 = 20% * [3000 + 3000 + 1000 + (100) + 300 + (100) + (300)]\)

% var 2 : This amount corresponds to  40%  of new Minority interests in the company A equity brought to company  \mathsf{A} + \mathsf{B} , that is  1600 = 40% * [2000 + 1700 + 300] .
