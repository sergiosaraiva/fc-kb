# Chunk 490: Potential Scenarios:

## Context

This section covers the equity method for 20-50% ownership stakes. Discusses relationships between entities: T.

## Content

## Potential Scenarios:
- If joint control agreement exists: Proportional consolidation
- If P has blocking rights: May affect control assessment
- Standard case: T controls, P has influence only


In its consolidated balance sheet, we would then find Minority Interests related to company A for an amount equal to  30%  of its equity valuated at the closing date.

But this valuation is exactly the same as the one that would be used in the consolidation of company P when applying the equity method to company A at  30% . If we suppose both P and T are consolidating with the same rules and

with no adjustments booked in A, Minority interests and Equity value would be equal.

This means that the methodology explained to justify Minority interests evolution can be reused exactly in the same way to justify the evolution of equity method participations.

The columns of the status board will also be non standard and adapted depending on the nature of the equity accounts and their evolution.
