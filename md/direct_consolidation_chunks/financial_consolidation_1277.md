### Answer 3.06

The first step when deconsolidating a company is to consolidate that company with the equity method.

The equity value would be  1350 = 50%  \* [2000 + 1000 + (300)].

The second step consists in modifying the value to bring it to the statutory financial investment of 1800. This can be done by a debit 450 on the equity value and a credit 450 on a profit account. This last booking is the answer.
