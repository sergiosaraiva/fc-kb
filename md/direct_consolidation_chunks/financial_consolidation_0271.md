### The situation

Beginning of Year 1, company A acquires an asset for a price of 110, including an amount of secondary costs for 10. This asset is depreciated over 10 years, so 11 at the end of Year 1.

The problem is that the group's rules of consolidation ask to book in P&L all secondary costs attached to an acquisition.


| A (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 110 | Capital 200 |
| Asset (Deprec.) | (11) | Reserves 0 |
| Cash | 90 | Result (11) |


Decision is taken to adjust that situation at consolidation level via adjustments.

During Year 2, the asset remains in company A and it is depreciated again for 11. Its net value is now  88 = 110 - 22 .


| A (Year 2) |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 110 | Capital | 200 |
| Asset (Deprec.) | (22) | Reserves | (11) |
| Cash | 90 | Result | (11) |


At the beginning of Year 3, company A sells this asset to  3rd  Parties for a price of 120, making a profit of  32 = 120 - 88 .
