### Elimination of intercompany amounts between an intercal company and a proportional company

We now consider company A consolidated by integration method and company B with the proportional method. Initially, intercompany reconciliation is made, no matter the consolidation method (global or proportional, equity not needed).

On the following example, we can see that in first column, company A has receivables with company B for 100 and company B has payables with company A for 100. So they agree.


|   |   | A | - Global | integration |   |   |   |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receivables/B Receivables/-Link account | 100 | (100)5050 |   |   |   |   |   |



|   | B - Proportional |  |  | Integration- | 50% |   |   |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|   |   | (1) | (2) |   |   | (1) | (2) |
| Link account |   |   | (50) | Payables/A | 100 | (50) | (50) |


Company B being consolidated with the proportional method, one of the preceding process has already eliminated  50%  of each amount of the balance sheet, included the intercompany amounts. That elimination is represented in column (1).

This means intercompany amounts between both companies are no longer reconciled.

The elimination will then consider that the receivables of 100 in company A accounts consist in two amounts: one intercompany amount of 50 with company B and an amount of 50 with the other partner of company B, who is considered as a  3^{rd}  Party.

The elimination adjustment in company A consists in eliminating the 100 receivables declared as intercompany and in transferring 50 to receivables with  3^{rd}  Parties (Receivables/-) and 50 to the Link account.

At the end of the consolidation process, the consolidated accounts will show remaining receivables of 50, but the Link account will be set to zero.

The process of elimination is exactly the same for the P&L, with another Link account.
