### What can we conclude about these three approaches?

The two last options produce the same goodwill of 200.

The first option produces a goodwill of 240 and an immediate result of 40. But, sooner or later, we know that these goodwills will finally be booked in the P&L.

This first option is maybe a little too "optimistic" and we would recommend to adopt a much more prudential attitude by choosing the third option because we show no profit in the P&L. Moreover, this adjustment must not be kept in the consolidation in the future.
