## Validations between flows

Some account variations have no impact on P&L but, referring to the double entry accounting, once a flow of a certain type is booked, there must be a counterpart on a flow of the same type on another account.

The transfer of an amount between two accounts is a good example.

Here are some other situations to consider

- Revaluation of assets having an impact on Revaluation reserves in equity  
- Difference on opening amounts is booked on a specific flow and, of course, total impact on assets and liabilities must be equal
