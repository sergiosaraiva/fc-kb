## Context

This section covers The adjustments = Year 3. Includes practical examples.

## Content

Over these three years, the net impact on P&L is 10 and the net impact after consolidation adjustments in also 10. Was it worth to adjust that situation? No considering the total impact, but yes if we look at individual years where the profit is quite different.

Did we have the choice to adjust or not. No if group's rules are clear and a materiality level is defined. This example indeed shows that it is quite a lot of work to adjust such situation. That's the reason why we recommend defining, in accordance with Auditors, realistic thresholds.

Over that difficulty, one should keep in mind that as soon as an asset has been adjusted by means of a consolidation adjustment, it is important to verify each year if the concerned asset is still in the accounts of the company.

In our example, if the reporting system doesn't ask such question, the risk is to continue to book consolidation adjustments for an asset that is no longer in the accounts!
