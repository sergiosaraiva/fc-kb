## Minority interests evolution

Here is the report


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends - | % var(1) | % var(2) | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| A | 320 | 17 | (80) | (40) | 60 | 277 |
|   | 320 | 17 | (80) | (40) | 60 | 277 |


which requires some additional comments for the  0 % var" columns, the other columns not needing comments.

%  var(1) shows the variation of  3^{rd}  Parties percentage in the opening equity of Year 2 as

\[
(40) = [ 16.67 % - 20 % ] * [ 1000 + 800 + (200) + (400) ]
\]

%  var(2) shows the  3^{rd}  Parties interests in the capital increase as

\[
60 = 16.67% * [320 + 40]
\]

Notice that  \(20 = (40) + 60\)  is the goodwill recognized in the consolidation.

But why do we have a goodwill on such capital increase? Was it expected?

This goodwill is a consequence of the additional price which should have been a refund of 80 instead of a payment of 40.

Before the transaction, we have seen that the equity was 1200 for 1000 shares issued, so 1.2 per share.

The transaction itself concerns 200 shares for a value of  360 = 320 + 40 , which gives a value of 1.8 per share. If, above the dividend of 320, company A would have refund 80, the value of one new share would have been  \(1.2 = (320 - 80) / 200\) .

Finally, on this revisited basis, the total equity becomes  1440 = 1200 + 240  for 1200 shares, existing and new, giving a value of  1.2 = 1440 / 1200  per share equal to the value of a share before the transaction.
