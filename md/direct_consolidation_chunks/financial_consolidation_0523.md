## Conclusions

If we are sure we have adjusted the necessary items, then we can state the final column on the right is the consolidated cash flow statement.

A few comments should be given before going further.

- Starting with technically correct statutory cash flow statement, the addition we made maintain a technically valid cash flow statement  
This method requires a good knowledge of all the events that have occurred in Year 2, with a good understanding of their cash influence  
- Moreover, the knowledge of what is happening during the consolidation process is also required. All consolidation adjustments modifying the result of a company have an impact in the cash flow statement, most of the time it merely leads to some reclassifications between result and non cash items without modifying the cash flow.

- A special care must be brought to dividends and capital increase to reflect the real cash out or cash in attached to these transactions.  
- Without really being aware of the fact, this group has acquired a new company and we didn't worry about a possible goodwill and we will see there is indeed one!  
- In the same way, the consolidated equity requires sometimes heavy calculations and difficult justification of evolution between two periods. The cash flow statement doesn't care about minority interests percentages. We 'think  100% "

The example we have just analyzed shows clearly that this method works for a limited number of companies. Adding statutory cash flow statements together is easy, but finding all the necessary adjustments to converge to the consolidated cash flow statement becomes impracticable for groups with a large number of companies, a priori if some are foreign companies. A professional consolidation software becomes a must.
