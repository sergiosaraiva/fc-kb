### Consolidated reserves evolution

This


|   | Year 1 reserves | Year 2 result | Dividends - | Dividends + | Dividends out | Year 2 reserves |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| FP | 0 | 0 |   | 16+7 | (23) | 0 |
| P1 | 20 | 21 | (10) | 15+4 |   | 50 |
| P2 | 30 | 7 | (20) | 15+3 |   | 35 |
| A | 40 | 25 | (30) |   |   | 35 |
|   | 90 | 53 | (60) | 60 | (23) | 120 |


report shows the four companies, including the fictitious parent company and is structured as explained in Part 2 and Part 3.

The only issue concerns the dividends. We first show correctly all dividends paid and received for a total of (60) and 60. However, the 23 received by FP are mentioned as 'Dividends out' in an appropriate column because it represents a cash amount that is leaving the group.

A final remark can be made about the booking of the owned shares of 70 as they should be transferred in equity when consolidating under IFRS rules. Depending on Local Gaap, maintaining the 70 as an asset can be acceptable.
