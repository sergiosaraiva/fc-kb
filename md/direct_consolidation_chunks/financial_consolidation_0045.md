## 3.1 The control percentage

Control could be defined as follows: "control of a company means the power by law or by fact to influence the description of the appointment of the directors or managers or to influence the company's management orientation".

Therefore, two types of controls exist: legal control and the de facto control.

The legal control exists when one company owns more than  50%  of the voting rights attached to the shares representing the capital of another company. This also means that it holds a majority on the Board of Directors. The presumption of legal control is irrefutable.
