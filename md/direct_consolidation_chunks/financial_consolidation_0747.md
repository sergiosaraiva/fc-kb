## Notes:
- Absorption gain of 300 = Consolidated reserves calculated as 100% × 1,000 - 700
- All A's assets and liabilities transferred except equity
- Financial investment in A eliminated as entity no longer exists


The booking of assets and liabilities of company A and the elimination of the financial investment is usually not a journal entry in balance. The amount reflecting the difference impacts the P&L and is called the gain or loss on absorption.

In some countries and depending on some local accounting regulations, the loss of absorption may be booked in the balance sheet as an intangible asset.

<!-- ========== CHUNK 31: DOC0038_pages_31_251127_155246.md ========== -->

In our example, the gain on absorption is 300 which can be detailed as follows :

\[
300 = 3000 - 2000 - 700 = 1000 - 700 = 100% * 1000 - 700
\]

which represents exactly the consolidated reserves calculated at the end of Year 1!

If we keep the accounts of P as they are and if we go ahead in a consolidation just after the absorption, we obviously will have to face a problem because consolidated reserves for 300 are again booked in the P&L of Year 2 because of this absorption. This cannot be maintained as such and the amount of 300 has to reversed into Reserves account.

The important message here is that we have to know the result of absorption and the account on which it has been booked in order to reverse the booking correctly.
