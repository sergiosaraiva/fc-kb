## Maximize automatic production of disclosures

The most important task between the end of the 'technical' step of the consolidation and the Auditors conclusions is the production of the consolidated disclosures (notes to the accounts).

There are two issues if we want to optimize the process.

First, as the disclosures consist mainly in figures in Excel spreadsheets and comments in Word documents, the final product is a merge of both. Today, some consolidation software offer solutions to link these spreadsheets directly to the consolidation data base and give the assurance that when opening these documents all figures are refreshed with the last version.

Moreover, it is also possible to imbed all these spreadsheets in a Word document.

Secondly, we are convinced that a large part of the comments on the accounts can be prepared before the consolidation is actually done. This means that part of this task should be prepared in December the latest before the closing.

The experience pictured from some groups has shown that taking these two issues into account has reduced the disclosures task from two or three weeks to a couple of days.
