### Consolidation - Year 2

Let's see how all these problems are booked in the Year 2 consolidation.


| P |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 1,000 |
|   |   | Reserves | 700 |
| Fin. Inv./B | 800 | (c) | 400 |
|   |   | Result | 200 |
|   |   | (c) | (400) |
| Other assets | 4,600 | Other liabilities | 3,500 |



| A |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 3,000 |
|   | Reserves | 2,000 |
|   | Result | 300 |
| Other assets | 6,600 | 1,300 |



|   |  | B |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill/A | (a) | 400 | Capital | 1,000 |
| (b) | (160) | Reserves | 900 |   |
| (e) | (65) | (b) | (160) |   |
| (f) | (58) | Result | (500) |   |
| Fin. Inv./A | (a) | 2,500 | (f) | 200 |
| (d) | (400) | (58) |   |   |
| (e) | (500) |   |   |   |
| Other assets | 1,600 | Other liabilities | 2,000 |   |


Adjustment (a): This is the gross goodwill transferred from company P to company A

Adjustment (b): Two depreciations amounts have been booked corresponding to Year 0 and Year 1, while the goodwill was in company P accounts. These historical values are now booked in company B accounts. To be careful, we don't book now the third  20%  depreciation corresponding to Year 2 for some reason explained when considering adjustment (e).

Adjustment (c): The group gain on shares disposal for an amount of  400 = 80% * 500  is eliminated. Company P keeps a gain of  \(100 = 500 + (400)\)  in its P&L, corresponding to the sale to  3rd  Parties. Counterpart of this elimination is the Reserves account.

Adjustment (d): The financial investment on company A includes a profit of 500 that we eliminate with a counterpart on the Reserves. After the

consolidation process, the group amount of (400) = 80% * (500) will compensate with the amount of 400 booked in company P accounts.

Adjustment (e): This is probably the most surprising and unexpected adjustment. We have indeed to calculate the impact of all these adjustments booked on Reserves and Financial investments, with direct impact on consolidated reserves.

On the financial investment side, the group goes from a value of  \(1600 = 2000 + (400)\)  in Year 1 to a value of  1280 = 80%  [2500 + (500) + (400)] in Year 2. The difference of 320 could be considered as the part of financial investment disposed.
