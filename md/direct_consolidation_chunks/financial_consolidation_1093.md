# 6 CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATMENT

The consolidated cash flow statement will be produced by first building the statutory cash flow statement for each individual company, that will be added together. Based on this approximation of the consolidated cash flow statement, we are going to book a certain number of adjustments to converge to the final consolidated cash flow statement.

The basic information consists in the statutory flows which is a new information it was not necessary to provide in the first part of our case study, excepted for the translation adjustments evolution.

For each company, we give Year 1 and Year 2 accounts and the flows explaining their evolution. The exercise consists in picking "cash" flows and to introduce them in the cash flow statement.

We are not giving the P&L which can be seen in the previous chapters. We will assume all validations are satisfied and, for instance, consider a depreciation flow as resulting from a depreciation account booked for the same amount in the P&L. The same comments can be made for provisions and gains/losses on disposals flows.
