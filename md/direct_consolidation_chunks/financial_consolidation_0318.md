### We suppose interim dividends are paid

Here are the accounts of company A owned by parent company P with a financial percentage of  80% . We suppose that an interim dividend of 10 is decided and will be paid in very short term, before the end of the year.

On the left, we have the accounts corresponding to the situation before the decision to pay an interim dividend.

On the right, we have the situation on December 31 including the booking of the interim dividend.

The recommendation for company A is to ask to book the counterpart of the cash out of 10 to the debit of the Reserves account. This will seem quite unusual for a local accountant but it is necessary for consolidation needs.

Parent company P will book the cash received for  8 = 80%  * 10 with a credit on Financial income (P&L).

The consolidation adjustment that will have to be booked is then a debit on this Financial income account and a credit on the Reserves account.

It is easy to see on this example that the Reserves account is playing a kind of link account because, in consolidation, it is impacted once in P account for credit 8 and in A account for debit  8 = 80% * 10 . Net impact on Reserves is then zero.
