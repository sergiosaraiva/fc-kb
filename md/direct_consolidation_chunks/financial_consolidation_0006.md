## Context

This section covers elimination entries in consolidation.

It's easy to see why, with these types of tools, the production of consolidated accounts and notes to the accounts could only be done on a very flexible schedule, especially if the extent of the group's perimeter rendered it somewhat complex.

Some readers will maybe remember that, at the time, there were already some "groups of groups" among the many quite large groups. They were real economic octopi present internationally and in nearly every business area.

These "super groups" are worth spending a little time on, and one in particular, for which we had the extraordinary opportunity to develop a consolidation system.

It consisted of nearly 2000 companies, split into about 20 subgroups. The latter were in turn treated as holdings because they were sometimes listed on several stock exchanges and, therefore, required to publish consolidated accounts before the parent company to which they reported.

How did this "super group" proceed?

The consolidator at the time used large format, pre-printed sheets of paper with columns like today's spreadsheets.

The accounts of the sub-groups appeared in successive columns and were followed by adjustments and eliminations. Of course, each sub-group had previously done its own consolidation in its own way.

Any errors or late amount changes required the use of an eraser and a significant amount of time for recalculations. At the end of the consolidation, its complexity was measured by the number of pencils and erasers used.

As for the schedule, the group published its consolidated accounts in October of the following year.

One cultural point should be noted: most annual reports at this time first presented the parent company's statutory accounts and the consolidated accounts appeared in the last pages of the appendix.

This presentation underscored their perceived importance at the time.

In fact, a very small audience among board members, banks and financial analysts could boast of fully understanding the contents of the amalgamated figures whose real usefulness was often questioned.

#### 1.2 The 1980s: The beginnings of the computer age

The inconvenience of consolidation work and the late schedule couldn't remain in place for long. There were still no personal computers at the beginning of the 1980s, but some computer companies, forerunners of future software vendors, took on the challenge and began to provide solutions.

The largest groups quickly showed an interest in the new software. It isn't hard to understand why! One software company came to the forefront in France in the early 1980s with its consolidation software.

Two functions stood out. On one hand, its concept of modularity covered the current "Segment Information" required by IFRS standards when a group is active in different fields. On the other, the innovative software ran on a Singer mini-computer, the well-known sewing machine manufacturer of the time...

While the functionality of this consolidation software quickly won over large groups, technical support was a major concern. It wasn't long before the software was completely rewritten in COBOL to run on an IBM 370 mainframe at service bureaus.
