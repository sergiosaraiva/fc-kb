## Consolidation evaluation rules

A company produces its local accounts on the basis of local evaluation rules which generally do not comply with group evaluation rules.

In order to keep a clear situation clear, we recommend building a consolidation bundle in which local figures are first keyed in and where separately, additional adjustments are booked in order to adapt the accounts to the group evaluation rules.

We then get a "three columns" presentation, that is

- Column 1: Local amounts  
- Column 2: Impact of adjustments  
- Column 3 : Adjusted amounts equal to Column 1 + Column 2

This presentation offers all audit trails views by explaining how we evolve from statutory accounts to adjusted accounts.
