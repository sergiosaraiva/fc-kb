### Generalisation to result. reserves and dividends

By a similar method, we deduce that the amount of translation adjustment of Year 2 impacting the reserves account after appropriation of the part of result which has not been paid as dividends is

\[
\begin{array}{r l} \mathrm {J 2} & = (\text {O p e n i n g r e s e r v e s Y 1} + \text {n o n d i s t r i b u t e d R e s u l t o f Y 1}) ^ {*} (\mathrm {C 2} - \mathrm {C 1}) \\ & + \mathrm {D} * (\mathrm {C 2} - \mathrm {A I}) \end{array}
\]

where D represents the amount of gross dividends paid and A1 is the average rate of Year 1.

As it can be seen, justifying the evolution of translation adjustments accounts rely more on "algebra" calculations than on economical information.

To comply with this kind of request, we recommend using a status board per company. That's what we are going to explain in the next section, on the basis on a realistic example.
