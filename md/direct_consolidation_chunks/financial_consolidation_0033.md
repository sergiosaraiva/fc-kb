## 2 CONSOLIDATION: A STEP BY STEP PROCESS

The consolidation process is a mix of lots of calculations, sometimes difficult situations to solve when group structure is changing, organization issues with correspondents, located all over the world, that sometimes you have even

never met, deadline issues to provide correct information just in time and so many people around you like CFO, Auditors, Bankers,... asking for information before you feel confident with it.

Facing such situation, keep in mind two key points during the consolidation process: Organization and Rigor.

We can define seven steps to achieve a consolidation.

Step 1: Identify the companies to include in the consolidation scope

Step 2: Collect the information from each company correctly and in time

Step 3: Translate all the information received into the consolidation currency

Step 4: Identify all intercompany differences and ask for explanations

Step 5: Book all necessary consolidation adjustments depending on group situation and consolidation rules

Step 6: Process all necessary eliminations to get a consolidated set of information

Step 7: Report consolidated figures to all addressees.

All along these steps, validation will be necessary and sometimes, reaching the end of the process, it may happen that previous steps will be revisited.

Such process implies a "spiral effect" until all reports show a consistency.

We propose now to give some additional information for each of these seven steps hereunder.
