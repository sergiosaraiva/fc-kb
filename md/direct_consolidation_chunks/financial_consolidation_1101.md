# DELTA = Statutory cash flow statement

Here we start with flow information in local currency.

Only one item needs a comment: the flow dividends on the cash account. The general principle for flows is to apply the Year 2 average rate for their translation into EUR. But there are some exceptions as for the dividends flow on the equity side which is translated at the Year 1 average rate.

Considering the fact these dividends are valuated with such rate, then the payment must also be valuated with the same rate. That's the reason why we extract a flow dividends for (400) from the net variation of cash for (1200). The remaining (800) is supposed to represent cash operations with the outside world and valuated at Year 2 average rate.

The main principles for the translation are

Year 1 amounts at Year 1 closing rate 0.8  
Year 2 amounts at Year 2 closing rate 0.9  
- All flows at Year 2 average rate 0.6, except "Dividends" and "Appropriation" flows at Year 1 average rate 0.7.

To balance in EUR the relation 'Opening + Sum of flows = Closing' for each line, we need to introduce a "Translation adjustment" flow.

One important check consists in verifying that the sum of this flow must be equal on assets and liabilities sides. This is the case with a total of 3040. If the payment of the dividends would have been translated at Year 2 average rate, for sure we would have found a mistake already in the statutory cash flow statement which would have been carried over in the consolidated cash flow statement.
