|   | P | A |   |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 150 | Capital | 5,000 |
| Reserves | 4,504 |   |   |
| Tangible assets | 6,720 | Result | (54) |
| Conso. Res.(A) | 3,366 |   |   |
| Trans. Adjust. | 906 |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 3,648 |   |   |
| Other assets | 23,500 | Other liabilities | 13,000 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = 3366 = 60% * [2000 + 2800 + 1000 + (280) + 2200 + (110)] - [1500 + (300)]  
Minority interests (A) = 3648 = 40% * [2000 + 2800 + 1000 + (280) + 2200 + (110) + 1400 + 200 + (90)]  
Translation adjustments  = 906 = 60%  \* [1400 + 200 + (90)]
