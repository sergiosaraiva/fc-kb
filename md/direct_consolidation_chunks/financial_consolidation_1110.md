## Column (2)

The elimination of the DELTA dividends for an amount of 168 has an impact on the result. Moreover the line "Dividends paid (other cies) ", in the added version of the cash flow statement, is presently too high because these 168 remain in the group. We must show only  \((112) = 40%\)  * (400) * 0.7 corresponding to the dividends paid to  3^{rd}  Parties.
