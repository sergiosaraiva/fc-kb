## Depending on the number of companies to consolidate. shall we apply the statee or the direct technique?

The question here makes sense when the group can be organized in different subgroups, in such case a first consolidation could be done by each subgroup. The final parent company would then reduce in an important way the number of companies to be consolidated directly on its level.

The decision for such organization should first be guided by the following comments:

Each subgroup contains a significantly important number of companies, in such a way that the consolidation process would become difficult to manage at parent company level, as a single consolidation site for the whole group.

- The persons in charge of the consolidation at each subgroup level will have an excellent understanding of the group rules of consolidation in order to produce consistent sub consolidated figures.  
- The geographical localisation of the subgroup head office and its held companies make difficult to maintain a contact with each entity.  
- One subgroup may be recently acquired and consolidated since a number of years. It could be considered as clumsy and delicate to suppress the function of consolidation. It is more a human resources issue than an organizational problem.

These comments brings along some arguments to consolidate subgroups but the management could also consider opposite comments

- There is a limited number of companies consolidated by a subgroup and it is just a non sense to keep this organization.  
- Maintaining several consolidation sites may generate some unacceptable over costs.  
- The group management prefers to consolidate directly each individual company in order to get a contribution view on all accounts.

Maintaining sub consolidations may present a risk to lengthen the deadlines.

The decision to consolidate by the stage technique or the direct technique is not easy because it implies so many different aspects. Nevertheless, we would recommend the direct technique whenever it is possible, even if some companies are unhappy about it.
