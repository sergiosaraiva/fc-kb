### Accountina approach and tree structure

A consolidation bundle should be developed on the basis of a standard group chart of accounts, considered as the skeleton of the structure. All

complementary reports of information are then linked in some way to that chart of accounts on a tree structure. By tree structure, we mean that one amount of one report may need additional information that will be asked in another report linked to the previous one.

The accounting approach applies also to a consolidation bundle allowing to adjust some local amounts. Keeping in mind that most group correspondents have an accounting background, these adjustments should be written as debits and credits instead of signed amounts in a single column.
