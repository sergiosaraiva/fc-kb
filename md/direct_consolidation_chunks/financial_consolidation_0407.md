# Chunk 407: Situation Analysis:

## Context

This section addresses foreign currency translation.

## Content

## Situation Analysis:
- Situation 1: No percentage changes (48% constant)
- Company B profit: 100
- Company B dividends: 50 (gross)


- Companies A and B are supposed to have their statutory accounts in consolidation currency. This condition is not a limitation because by the currency translation step, we reclassify on the Translation adjustments account the currency effects in order to make the evolution of statutory reserves compatible with classical accounting principles.  
- We will calculate only company B consolidated reserves and try each time to justify their evolution from Year 1 to Year 2.
