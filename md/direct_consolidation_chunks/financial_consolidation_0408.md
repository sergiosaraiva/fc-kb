### Situation 1 : The result and dividends effects

In this first step we suppose there are no changes in the percentages over the two years and the indirect financial percentage in company B is  48% = 80% 60% .

Company B has a statutory profit of 100 and pays a gross dividend of 50 to its shareholders.


|   |  | Year 1 | Year 2 |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Company A | Fin. Inv./B | 600 | 600 |
|   |  |  |  |
| Company B | Capital | 1,000 | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 800 | 950 |   |
| Result | 200 | 100 |   |


Consolidated reserves of B for each year are equal to

-  {480} = {48}%  * \left\lbrack  {{1000} + {800} + {200}}\right\rbrack  - {80}% {}^{ * }{600}  for Year 1  
-  504 = 48%  * [1000 + 950 + 100] - 80% * 600 for Year 2

giving a variation of  24 = 504 - 480  which consists of two components, namely

-  48 = 48%  * 100 corresponding to the group part of the result  
(24)  = 48%  (50) corresponding to the group part of the dividends

That is the conclusion we expected from an accounting point of view.
