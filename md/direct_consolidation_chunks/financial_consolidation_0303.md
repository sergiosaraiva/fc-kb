# Consolidation of Year 1

Let's go back to the statutory accounts


| P (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Fin. Invest./A | 80 | Capital 200 |
| Reserves 100 |   |   |
| Result 30 |   |   |
| Other assets | 420 | Other liabilities 170 |



| A (Year 1) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 100 Reserves 50 Result 20 |
| Other assets 400 | Other liabilities 230 |


which do not include adjustments.

Based on the global integration method, here is the consolidated balance sheet


| P + A (Year 1) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Capital 200 |
|   | Reserves 100 |
|   | Result 30 |
|   | Conso. Reserves (A) 56 |
|   | Minor. Interests (A) 34 |
| Other assets | 820 |
| Other liabilities | 400 |


in which

- Consolidated reserves  = 56 = 80% \left[100 + 50 + 20\right] - 80  
Minority interests  = 34 = 20%  [100 + 50 + 20]

other assets and other liabilities being just the addition of the corresponding A and P accounts.
