# Chunk 9: 3 The 1990s: The search for a miracle solution

## Context

This section covers 3 The 1990s: The search for a miracle solution.

## Content

The approaches were based on different software. Specialised software was used for statutory consolidation and Lotus (followed by Excel) was often used for reporting. Staff often came up through different training channels with more or less detailed-oriented information systems, with complete or partial perimeters, based on different frequencies, etc. In other words, two different figures universes coexisted in the groups.

Recognising this, software companies reacted very quickly and launched the concept of 'unified consolidation".

Did the decade end with a miracle product? Not really.

The software developed primarily by European companies with a Latin culture tended to offer functionally complete statutory consolidation software with a few reporting functions which were deemed to be insufficient.

The software developed by Anglo-Saxon companies provided excellent reporting functionality but was relatively incomplete in terms of statutory functionality where everything had to be set up with parameters. American groups, which often had vast perimeters, had .much simpler tree structures with fully owned companies.

The market was clearly moving toward a unified solution. However, vendor culture resulted in software that was either more heavily biased toward statutory consolidation or to reporting.

Unified consolidation didn't perfectly match market expectations at the end of the decade.

#### 1.4 The 2000s: Y2K and IFRS

The turn of the century (Y2K in the English-language media of the time) disappointed many journalists looking for a sensational story because the long-anticipated bug didn't negatively affect accounting systems and the performance of consolidation software packages received high marks.

Another much more critical deadline awaited listed groups in 2005: the implementation of IFRS standards to apply to all public companies belonging to member states of the European Community.

The goal was infinitely praiseworthy given that the decision removed the haziness of the 7th Directive of 1983.

By setting standards for all Member States, Europe was making consolidated accounts comparable from the standpoint of both content and form for companies in similar lines of business, regardless of the Member State they were located in. Hadn't the United States applied the same approach throughout its states and with US Gaap for quite some time already?

Was the European goal achieved after a few years of IFRS? The answer isn't straightforward.

From a content standpoint, IFRS is voluminous, changing and interpreted, making it difficult to implement uniformly across listed companies.

We have often come across qualified or even very different opinions on a similar situation, sometimes from two partners of the same firm.

From the standpoint of form, some states like Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Italy and Poland have imposed a national publication standard for statutory accounts for many years now.

When the first consolidated accounts were published, groups found it normal to follow a recommended scheme... which didn't exist and has never been proposed by Member States.

With the advent of IFRS, each group created their own publication standards. Items that didn't appear explicitly on a balance sheet or income statement could be put in an attached table or in a note.
