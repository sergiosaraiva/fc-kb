# MU - Statutory cash flow statement

This company enters the consolidation scope on July  1st , Year 2. This means that we don't have the Year 1 closing amounts.

In such situation, the balance sheet accounts existing at that date are booked on a special flow "Entering conso".

Here are our comments on the cash flow

- Retained earnings account is equal to 1200, already including the 200 profit of the first half year.  
However, the Result in the Year 2 closing amounts is still 500 but the flow splits into 200 for  1^{st}  half year and 300 for  2^{nd}  half year.  
- The flow "Entering conso" has no impact on the cash flow statement because it contains information about the period preceding the life time of the company in the group.  
Investments transactions reflect transactions with the outside world and, in particular, the disposals generate no gain or loss.

We can check again that the 'Net cash variation" deducted from the cash flow statement is equal to the net cash variation in the balance sheet.
