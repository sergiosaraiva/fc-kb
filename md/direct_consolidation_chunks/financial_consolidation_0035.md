### 2.2 Step 2: Collect the information from each company correctly and in time

The information needed for a consolidation may depend on the reference (Local Gaap or IFRS) but also on what the Board, Auditors, Bankers are expecting.

In any case, there is a minimal set of information required for each company, which consists in

A balance sheet and its P&L  
- A detail of the financial investment accounts in other companies of the consolidation scope, including explanations on the evolution of such accounts  
- Intercompany positions which consist of transactions made by the company with all other companies and that are still open in the balance  
- Flows on all balance sheet accounts, which consist in explaining the evolution of these accounts between opening and closing dates.

That information is usually collected by the mean of what is called a "consolidation bundle", usually a spreadsheet or a web solution.

We will not give a full description of such a consolidation bundle here but let's limit us to some important points.

- A bundle should be personalized to each company. This means that last closing period figures will be present without possibilities to update them because they have been used and audited in the previous consolidation.

- A spreadsheet bundle very often consists in a quite large number of sheets in a workbook. Most of these sheets are linked together via formulas and macros. On the top of these sheets we find a set of validation rules. Experience shows that companies are asking the more complete and severe validation rules as possible. Why? Because when they send the consolidation bundle to the consolidation department, they are sure the information reaches the expected level of quality.

- A consolidation bundle should contain figures in local currencies. It is not advisable to ask companies to translate themselves their local currency figures into consolidation currency. Year after year, that translation is becoming more and more difficult. It should remain the responsibility of the consolidation office.

- When the evaluation rules of the group differ from the local rules, and this is very often the situation with IFRS, the question arises to know who is booking the necessary adjustments to comply with the group rules. The recommended position is to apply the 'push down' approach and to ask the company to book these adjustments. Very often, the company is not allowed to book these adjustments directly in its local accounting. So it is helpful to develop a consolidation bundle including the possibility to receive these adjustments. The consolidation bundle then presents a '3 columns' structure: column 1 for Local Gaap amounts, column 2 for impact of adjustments and column 3 which is the addition of the two first columns. This last column is usually the one that is consolidated (adjusted amounts).
