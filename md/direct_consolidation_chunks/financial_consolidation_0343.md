### Method 1: Statutory view versus Consolidation view

At the end of chapter 4, when considering the equity method consolidation, we explained that in consolidation the value of a company was the value of its equity and the problem is that the transaction is booked based not on that equity value but on the historical value of the financial investment in P accounts.


| In consolidation |  |
| --- | ---: |
| Disposal price | 500 |
| Equity of company A |   |
| Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 600 |
| Profit before disposal | 50 |
| Consolidation adjust. (Revaluation) | 200 |
| Total | 1,850 |
| Percentage disposed | 20% |
| Group equity | 370 |
| Gain on disposal | 130 |
| Book 1/4 of goodwill to P&L | 100 |
| Final gain on disposal | 30 |


Here is the gain on disposal calculated with statutory figures.


| In statutory accounts |  |
| --- | ---: |
| Disposal price | 500 |
| Shares value | 300 |
| Gain on disposal | 200 |


In consolidation, we consider the adjusted equity. We mean statutory equity and the revaluation of the land for 200. Moreover, the  20%  shares of company A being disposed on July  1^{st} , Year 2, we also include the 50 profit of the first six months of the year.  20%  of the total, 1850, equals 370 which is the equity value of these shares. A first gain is the difference between the selling price and that equity value, 130. Now, initially we booked a goodwill of 400 corresponding to  80%  of shares initially acquired. As we remain with only

60%  after that transaction,  100 = 20% / 80% * 400  must be booked as a reduction of that gain, giving a net gain of 30.

Comparing both approaches, the first one gives a gain of 200 and the second one a gain of 30 and we have to give priority to the consolidation approach of course. This leads to the following adjustment reducing the statutory gain from 200 to 30


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 170 |   |
| Consolidated reserves |   | 170 |


and we must admit that for inexperienced readers, the booking of consolidated reserves can seem a little bit strange.

Let's try to clarify this point with the second method.

Method 2 : A step by step approach

This method contains three main steps

- First we reverse the statutory transaction  
- Then we take into account historical adjustments and equity value of the shares disposed instead of the statutory financial investment  
Finally, we make the transaction with these values.

Reverse the statutory transaction by booking the following adjustment


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Fin. Invest./A | 300 | 500 |
