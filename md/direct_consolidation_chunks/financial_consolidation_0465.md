## 3.3 Case study

In this case study, we are going to analyze three years of consolidation with the following foreign currency equity evolution and the corresponding rates that will be used.


|   | Year 1 CUR | Capital increase | Approp. | Result | Year 2 CUR | Approp. | Divid. | Result | Year 3 CUR |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Capital | 100 | 50 |   |   | 150 |   |   |   | 150 |
| Reserves | 80 |   | 20 |   | 100 | 20 |   |   | 120 |
| Result | 20 |   | (20) | 30 | 30 | (20) | (10) | 10 | 10 |
|   | 200 | 50 | 0 | 30 | 280 | 0 | (10) | 10 | 280 |



| Closing rate | 10 |   |   |   | 14 |   |   |   | 12 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| Average rate | 11 |   |   |   | 13 |   |   |   | 10 |
| Hist. Rate | 9 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Trans. Rate |   | 12 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |


That company enters the group on the  1^{st}  of January Year 1 with a total equity of 180 translated at the historical rate of 9. During Year 2, the capital is increased by 50 at a transaction rate of 12.

A the end of Year 2, the company pays gross dividends of 10.

We propose to proceed in two steps. We first calculate the historical equity of each year and book the corresponding translation adjustments amount on the appropriate account.

We then fill in the status board to justify the evolution of translation adjustments.
