# Chunk 733: Consolidation - Year 2

## Context

This section explains goodwill calculation in financial consolidation. Contains formula: of  52 = 320 - 268 .. Shows detailed calculations.

## Content

On the equity side, the group goes from a value of  \((160) = (80) + (80)\)  in Year 1 to  \((128) = 80% * (160)\)  in Year 2, concerning the cumulated goodwill depreciations, which represents a gain on equity of  \(32 = (128) - (160)\) .

On the other hand, the group is loosing some company A equity by decreasing from  30%  to  24%  on an opening equity of 5000, that is  \((300) = [24% - 30%]^{\star} [3000 + 20001\) .

The net loss in equity is  \((268) = 32 + (300)\) .

Let's summarise the situation. We can consider that the group 'sells" an equity of 268 for a "price" of 320, making a profit" of  52 = 320 - 268 .

We decide to book this gain on the goodwill in order to decrease its value.

However, the amount of 52 is a group amount and we are going to book it in company B which is consolidated at  80% . In order to avoid mixing up closing assets amounts and group assets amounts, we adapt this 52 amount to become  \(65 = 52^{*} (100% / 80%)\)

Adjustment (f): The net goodwill opening value is now  \(175 = 400 + (160) + (65)\)  and its remaining period of depreciation is three years, so we depreciate it by  58 = 175 / 3  in Year 2.

Finally, here are the consolidated accounts


|   | P + A + B |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Goodwill | 117 | Capital | 1,000 |
| Reserves | 1,100 |   |   |
| Result | (200) |   |   |
| Equity value (A) | 1,590 | Conso. Res.(A) | (60) |
| Conso. Res.(B) | 306 |   |   |
| Minority int.(A) | 318 |   |   |
| Minority int.(B) | (57) |   |   |
| Other assets | 6,200 | Other liabilities | 5,500 |


where

- Consolidated reserves (A) = (60) = 24% [3000 + 2000 + 300] - 80% [2500 + (500) + (400) + 65]  
- Consolidated reserves (B) = 306 = 80% * [1000 + 900 + (160) + (500) + 200 + (58)] - 800  
Minority interests (A) = 318 = 6% * [3000 + 2000 + 300]  
Minority interests (B)  \equiv  (57)  = 20%  * [1000 + 900 + (160) + (500) + 200 + (58)] - 20% * [2500 + (500) + (400) + 65]  
Equity value (A)  = 1590 = 30%  [3000 + 2000 + 300]
