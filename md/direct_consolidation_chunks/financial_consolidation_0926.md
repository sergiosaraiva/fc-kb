## Validations between flows and P&L accounts

These validations are much more accounting oriented than the previous ones.

The objective is to be sure all notes to the accounts, including the cash flow statement, will be consistent.

The background of these validations is to verify that some non cash variations on balance sheet accounts are equal to the corresponding amounts booked in the P&L.

Without being necessarily complete, here are the main accounts to verify

- Variation of depreciations on depreciation assets accounts  
- Variation of provisions  
Write-offs and write-backs booked on financial investments (consolidated and not consolidated)  
- Same for non current and current receivables  
- Unrealized exchange gain and loss on all accounts, including intercompany amounts  
- Gain/loss on assets disposal  
- Variations of assets and liabilities deferred taxes

Depending on local accounting rules, we could also mention

- Capitalization of works  
Use of investment grants  
- Untaxed reserves booked in P&L
