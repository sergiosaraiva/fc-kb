# Chunk 472: 4.2 How to explain variations?

## Context

This section describes global integration method for controlled subsidiaries. Contains formula: p l = (M 1 + V) ^ {*} p 2 - M 1 ^ {*} p l = M 1 ^ {*} (p 2 - p l) + V ^ {*} p 2. Includes practical examples.

## 4.2 How to explain variations?

The problem is quite simple and we can give a general approach for a "conceptual" account because it will apply to any other equity or financial account.

We will see that only the financial nature of the variation, depending of the account, will have to be stored in an appropriate column of the status board.

Suppose that the minority percentage for Year 1 is p l and for Year 2 is p2. p l or p2 may be  0% , depending on the consolidation method or the fact that we consider a global integration company owned at  100% .

We now consider one equity amount M1 in Year 1 and M2 in Year 2, with a variation V. Of course, we can write  \mathsf{M}2 = \mathsf{M}1 + \mathsf{V} . This situation can apply to any account. V could be a capital increase, a dividend paid, a translation adjustment variation, an increase of grants, ...

The consolidation process calculates Minority interests respectively equal to M1 * p I for Year 1 and M2 * p2 for Year 2 and we are interested in explaining the variation

\[
M 2 ^ {*} p 2 - M 1 ^ {*} p l = (M 1 + V) ^ {*} p 2 - M 1 ^ {*} p l = M 1 ^ {*} (p 2 - p l) + V ^ {*} p 2
\]

where we see that the net variation always consists in two components

- The first component showing the percentage variation p2 - p1 between Year 2 and Year 1 in the opening value M1 of the account  
- The second component showing the Year 2 percentage p2 in the variation.

Let's just see what we get with this formula considering a capital increase in the following example


|   | Year 1 | Capital increase | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | ---: |
| Capital | 100 | 40 | 140 |
| Minority % | 30% |   | 20% |
| Minority interests | 30 |   | 28 |


where we can see that the variation of Minority interests to justify is (2).

The status board would mention the following two elements

A variation in the opening amount for  100^{\star} \((20% - 30%) = (10)\)

And  20% * 40 = 8  corresponding to the part of the  3^{rd}  Parties in the capital increase.
