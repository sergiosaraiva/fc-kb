### Cash from investments and disinvestments activities

This category represents all acquisitions of intangible, tangible and financial assets on one side and all disposals of these same items on the other side.

Obviously, investments will appear with a negative sign, representing a cash out, and the opposite for all disinvestments.

Nothing special should be added to this if we speak about a statutory cash flow statement, but on the other hand it becomes a problem while considering the consolidated cash flow statement because acquisitions and disposals of consolidated financial investments are eliminated in the balance sheet.

We will have to come back more deeply to that issue later in this chapter.
