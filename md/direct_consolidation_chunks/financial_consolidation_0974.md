### CONSOLIDATION OF YEAR 1

For this consolidation, we will use one spreadsheet per company, the first column corresponding to its statutory accounts and the next columns on the right are used for consolidation adjustments and eliminations.

The last column on the right is the contribution of the company to the consolidated balance.

Each column is identified by a number referencing to additional explanations.

For practical reasons, these accounts are presented on a left page with an even number. If necessary, the same accounts are repeated on the next even page depending on the number of columns needed.
