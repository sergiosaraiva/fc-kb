## Dividend Information:
- P1 pays dividend of 10
- P2 pays dividend of 20
- A pays dividend of 30
- Consolidation adjustments required to eliminate group dividends


This group will be consolidated over Year 1 (column 1) and Year 2 (column 2) on the basis of the following statutory accounts.

Looking at the equity of each company, we confirm

- Company P1 is paying a dividend of 10  
- Company P2 is paying a dividend of 20  
Company A is paying a dividend of 30

And that's the reason why we already booked consolidation adjustments to eliminate group dividends.


|   |  |  | P1 |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./P2 | 40 | 40 | Capital | 100 | 100 |
| Fin. Inv./A | 50 | 50 | Reserves | 0 | 10 |
|   |   |   |   |   | 15 |
|   |   |   |   |   | 4 |
|   |   |   | Result | 20 | 40 |
|   |   |   |   |   | (15) |
|   |   |   |   |   | (4) |
| Other assets | 110 | 210 | Other liabilities | 80 | 150 |



|   |   | P2 |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Fin. Inv./P1 | 30 | 30 | Capital | 200 |
| Fin. Inv./A | 50 | 50 | Reserves | 0 |
|   |   |   |   | 15 |
|   |   |   |   | 3 |
|   |   |   | Result | 30 |
|   |   |   |   | 25 |
|   |   |   |   | (15) |
|   |   |   |   | (3) |
| Other assets | 320 | 420 | Other liabilities | 170 |
|   |   |   |   | 265 |



| A |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: |
|   |   |   | Capital | 100 | 100 |
|   |   |   | Reserves | 0 | 10 |
|   |   |   | Result | 40 | 25 |
| Other assets | 300 | 400 | Other liabilities | 160 | 265 |


Now we have to build the balance sheet of the fictitious company FP keeping in mind that the capital of a consortium is the sum of the capital amount of each parent of the consortium, so  300 = 100 + 200 .

On the assets side, we will balance that capital with financial investments on P1 and P2 by considering the percentage owned and acting on the corresponding capital. This means the financial investment on P1 will be  70 = 70% * 100  and on P2  160 = 80% * 200 .
