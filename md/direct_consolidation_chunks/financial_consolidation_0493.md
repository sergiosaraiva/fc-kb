### The cash flow statement

The basic idea behind the cash flow statement is to explain how a group managed its cash with the outside world all along the consolidation period.

There is no standard format for the cash flow statement but, beyond this problem of presentation, all groups consider three main categories, namely cash related to

- Operating activities  
Investments and disinvestments  
Financial transactions

The information necessary to build a cash flow statement comes from some P&L accounts and from flows and we will see that if justifying consolidated reserves is sometimes a quite technical challenge, building a correct cash flow statement requires a great deal of rigor at any time of the consolidation process.

The main reason for this is the fact that we must keep in mind that only cash items will be used in the cash flow statement, while cash transactions between group companies cannot appear.

#### The orocess of buildina a consolidated cash flow statement

Some basic recommendations can already be issued in order to bring a chance of success on our side while building a cash flow statement.

Each group company should provide a correct local currency statutory cash flow statement as an input to the consolidation process  
Each consolidation adjustment should be booked, after checking the cash and non cash impacts

- A very strong knowledge of all financial and investments transactions in the group is a necessary guarantee to achieve the work.

Of course, all technical issues such as currency rates changes, changes in consolidation scope, changes in consolidation methods will be highly under control and understood because these technical effects could present some important and unexpected effects.
