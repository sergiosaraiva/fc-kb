### The situation

Here is a group where parent company P has a financial investment in company A for 1000 corresponding to a  100%  financial percentage. We can suppose company A has been founded by P a few years ago.

Equity of company A is

Capital : 1000  
Retained earning : (600)  
Loss of Year 1: (200)

giving a net equity of 200.

In Year 1, consolidated reserves are (800) = 100% * 200 - 1000 and this amount is just the accumulated losses of A since the first consolidation.

In Year 2, P decides to book a write-off on that investment for the full amount of 1000. This means the financial investment is now zero.

In the meantime, we receive company A accounts

Capital : 1000  
Retained earning : (800)  
Loss of Year 1 : (200)

again with a loss of (200), leading to a net equity of zero.

Without doing anything about this situation in the consolidation, we would calculate consolidated reserves as  0 = 100% * 0 - 0 .

But the evolution between (800) and 0 is supposed to correspond to the result of this year, (200), which is not the case.

The problem comes from the fact that, on one side, we show the bad situation of company A in the consolidated figures by consolidating the company and on the other side, by booking a write-off, P is saying company A situation is bad. If we do nothing, we are saying twice that A situation is bad with different figures. Duplication and contradiction problems arise.
