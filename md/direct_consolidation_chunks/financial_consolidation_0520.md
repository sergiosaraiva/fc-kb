### Adjustment 32

In consolidation, we eliminate dividends received from consolidated companies, as it has been explained in Part 2 Chapter 8. This means the company P statutory profit of 80 must be reduced by 24 corresponding to the  80% * 30  of dividends received.

But there is a counterpart to this adjustment. The dividends paid as mentioned on line "Dividends" in the cash flow statement show a payment of (30) in A. In fact (24) remains in the group by being paid to P. Only (6) represents a cash out corresponding to dividends paid to  3rd  Parties.
