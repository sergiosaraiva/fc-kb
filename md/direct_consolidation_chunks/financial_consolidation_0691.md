## Content

|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Goodwill | 100 |   |
| Fin. Invest./A |   | 100 |


Of course, the gross goodwill attached to these shares has to be booked back in the balance sheet.

Reserves Goodwill

Debit Credit

And we do the same for the corresponding impairments.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity value | 1,026 |   |
| Fin. Invest./A |   | 400 |
| Trans. Adjust. Reserves | 78 | 704 |


We now reach a critical step. We say that what we sell is the equity value of these  20%  of shares and not the statutory value. Going back to the definition, the equity value of a foreign company is equal to its equity translated

at closing rate. An equivalent way to say it is to consider the historical rate equity plus the translation adjustments amount, giving  \(1026 = 20% * [2000 + 2000 + 1000 + (200) + 800 + (80) + (300) + (100) + 10]\) .

This equity value replaces the statutory financial investment adjusted by the badwill, so  \(400 = 500 + (100)\) .

By already explaining that approach in Part 2 for the disposal of a consolidation currency company, we know the counterpart is the Reserves account. But, in this situation, reserves do not include these translation adjustments and this is the reason why we have to book them individually as shown in this adjustment with  \((78) = 20%\)  \*  \([(300) + (100) + 10]\) .


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Cash | 900 |   |
| Equity value |   | 1,026 |
| Trans. Adjust. |   | 78 |
| Loss on disposal | 204 |   |


We now conclude the transaction at consolidation level, of course for the same price of 900 but we are selling the equity value. The translation adjustments attached to the shares disposed cannot remain in the

consolidated accounts any more and that's the reason why we eliminate them through the P&L. We finally find a loss of disposal for 204 as in the previous method.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Impairment | 50 |   |
| Goodwill |   | 50 |


The net goodwill of 50 is also eliminated through the P&L.


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | ---: | :--- |
| Gain on disposal | 400 |   |
| Loss on disposal | 204 |   |
| Impairment | 50 |   |
| Reserves |   | 654 |


To reach the conclusion, we would propose to aggregate all these six adjustments above to get the single one here on the left. It is the same adjustment as in the previous method.
