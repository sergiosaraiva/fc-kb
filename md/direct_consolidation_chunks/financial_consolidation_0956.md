## Optimize communication with Auditors

At the end of the consolidation process, Auditors receive the consolidated accounts on a support agreed beforehand (paper, Excel, pdf reports, readily access to the consolidation software).

After having received a "Reporting Version 1", some Auditors communicate their first remarks and ask to receive a "Reporting Version 2" so they can visualize the impact of the requested changes. Of course, this second reporting is to be compared with the first one and not with the reference consolidation. And the situation may be repeated several times.

We would recommend negotiating with Auditors to produce a 'temporary version" for audit purpose on which they hand over all their remarks. They receive then a "final version".

If possible, ask also to get some guarantee that the same team will audit the next consolidations, otherwise you will have to repeat the story each time.

This is also a way to avoid wasting time.
