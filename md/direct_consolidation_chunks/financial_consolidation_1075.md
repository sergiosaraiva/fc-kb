### CTA

We know that  3^{rd}  Parties are taking their percentage in the currency translation adjustments, including opening, closing and evolution amount.

In our case study, this evolution amount is  \(604 = 40% * [600 - (910)]\) , where 600 is the closing amount and (910) is the opening amount. These two amounts can be found in Year 2 and Year 1 DELTA consolidation adjustments explained above.
