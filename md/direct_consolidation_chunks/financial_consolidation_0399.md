## Minority interests

We consider a company with its statutory equity, including consolidation adjustments.

Moreover, for foreign companies, we suppose that equity is translated into consolidation currency.

Minority interests are then calculated as  100%  less the indirect financial percentage in each company consolidated by the global integration method.

It is important to notice that all accounts are considered in this calculation, including revaluation reserves, badwill, translation adjustments and grants.

To say it in another way, minority interests are calculated on equity at closing rate while consolidated reserves are calculated on historical rate equity, not including revaluation reserves, badwill, translation adjustments and grants for which the group part is presented in the consolidated equity separately.

To be complete in our explanation, we have to describe two special situations with regard to minority interests.

First, when a company A owns shares of a company B, but company A is consolidated with an indirect financial percentage of less than  100% , Minority interests have to be calculated also in the financial investment amount on company B booked in company A.

Secondly, in a basic approach (Part 2), we have explained that there were Minority interests only in global integration companies. This remains not necessarily true in some group structures where a global integration company owns, for instance, an equity method company. In such situation, there is

what we call indirect minority interests in the equity method company. This situation will be explained with more details in the case studies of Part 4.
