## Context

This section covers Adjustment (d). Contains formula: so  16 = 40% * 40 ..

## Content

### Adjustment (d)

We also notice that company A making a 12 months profit of 100 and a first half-year profit of 60, the second half-year profit is 40 which has to be evaluated at  40%  as "Profit EM" account, so  16 = 40% * 40 .

The amount of 40 initially calculated must be reduced by 24.

These three adjustments are just reclassifications between P&L accounts. The balance sheet needs no adjustments.
