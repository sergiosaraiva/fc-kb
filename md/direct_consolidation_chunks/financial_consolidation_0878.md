# PART 5 ORGANIZATION OF A CONSOLIDATION AND FAST CLOSE

Control percentages close to  50%

If there is no specific shareholders agreement, the number of voting rights is the only criterion to consider.  50%  of voting rights in hand less one voting right means the equity method and plus one voting right means the global integration method.

When exactly  50% , one needs additional information to choose the consolidation method.

Under IFRS rules, the equity method applies. Under Local Gaap, we need a limited number of shareholders and a shareholder agreement confirming that each one cannot decide on its own without the approval of all the other shareholders. In such case proportional integration method or equity method are the acceptable candidates. The choice of one or the other depends on internal defined rules.

Financial investors

Above the figures, we want to point out a majority shareholder, generally a financial investor, refusing his majority rights because it is just not his business. In such situation, the group accepting the control with less than  50%  voting rights will have to consolidate the company by the global integration method.

Presence to annual aeneral meetinos

A group with less than  50%  voting rights, attend regularly the annual general meetings of a company while all other shareholders are never present, gives to the group a control "de facto" and the global integration method for that company.

Why insisting on the level of control? For two main reasons.

First, a consolidation method implies for the concerned company a full reporting, if integration or proportional method, or a reduced reporting if equity method. The company should be informed of the group choice as soon as possible in order to organize its own information system.

Secondly, a wrong choice of a consolidation method has two bad consequences. A change of a consolidation method has to be explained in the notes to the accounts and it can become a challenge for a company to be informed sometimes a little late that it has to skip from the reduced to the full reporting package in a short delay.
