### The adjustments

The transaction is supposed to be labelled in EUR and so we are going to adjust B accounts by considering the Payables/A too high, the difference consisting in a currency effect. Speaking about a transaction that will be paid within a short term, we consider the amount of 71 as an exchange gain impacting the result.

The Purchases/A are also too high for 214, but here they are already booked in the P&L and we have to consider that amount as an expense booked on a wrong account. In fact, these 214 should be considered as an exchange loss.

Here is the impact of these two adjustments


| B (EUR) |  |
| --- | --- |
|   | Result (1,214) 71 Trans. Adj. 143 Payables/A 1,071 (71) |
| Purchases/A 1,214 (214) Exchange loss (71) 214 Result (1,214) 71 |   |


where 71 is indeed an exchange gain, but we have to net that amount with the exchange loss of 214, both amounts coming from a single transaction.

Note also that the adjustment of 71 will need to be reversed next year after the payment of the invoice.
