### Disposal of an asset from a company in foreign currency to a company in consolidation currency

Company A, whose accounts are in local currency (CUR), sells a land to company B whose accounts are in consolidation currency (EUR). The transaction doesn't generate any group profit.


| Company A (CUR) Closing rate Average rate | Year 1 [5] | Net variation [7] | Disposal [7] | Year 2 [9] [7] |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Land | 100 |   | (100) | 0 |
| Cash | 200 | 100 |   | 300 |
| Payables | 300 |   |   | 300 |
| Company B (EUR) | Year 1 | Net variation | Acquisiton | Year 2 |
| Cash | 1,000 | (800) |   |   |
| Pa abilities | 1 000 |   |   | 1 000 |


In the heading of each column, we mention between [] the rates used for currency conversion. Moreover, these accounts show that A is selling the land for an amount of 100 EUR, which is booked in B accounts, after currency translation, for an amount of 800 EUR, corresponding to a day rate.

Of course, once company A accounts are translated into EUR, we get the following situation


| Company A (EUR) | Year 1 | Net variation | Disposal | CTA | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Land | 500 |   | (700) | 200 | 0 |
| Cash | 1,000 | 700 |   | 1,000 | 2,700 |
| Payables | 1,500 |   |   | 1,200 | 2,700 |


and if we accept these figures as they are, the consolidated situation of these two companies gives


| Consolidation | Year 1 | Net variation | Acquisiton Disposal | CTA | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| Land | 500 |   | 100 | 200 | 800 |
| Cash | 2,000 | (100) |   | 1,000 | 2,900 |
| Payables | 2,500 |   |   | 1,200 | 3,700 |


Because that transaction is internal to the group, we have to net the "Acquisition" and "Disposal" flows and this is where we see that we have a problem with a remaining amount of 100 that should be 0.

We could accept it as it is, but the cash flow statement would show

- An acquisition of 100 that has no economic background, even if it would be technically correct. This amount of 100 has to be reclassified as a currency translation amount (CTA).  
- A cash impact of (100) and no cash transaction happened with the outside world.

These two amounts must be reclassified as CTA as indicated in bold figures hereunder


| Consolidation | Year 1 | Net variation | Acquisiton Disposal | CTA | Year 2 |
