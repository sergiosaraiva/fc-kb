# MU = Contribution to consolidated cash flow statement

The statutory cash flow statement we have considered previously shows the cash activity for the  2^{nd}  half year only, the  1^{st}  half year having been already booked on the "Entering conso" flow.

Moreover, there is no adjustment for this company. The statutory cash flow statement will then be the contribution to the consolidated cash flow statement.
