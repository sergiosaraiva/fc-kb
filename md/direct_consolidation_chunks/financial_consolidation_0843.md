### How has this real situation been consolidated as at December Year 2?

We have adopted a logic of continuity by considering that  A  has not left the group for two months.

The  100%  disposal of company A shares to  3rd  Parties has been qualified as a group transaction implying the elimination of the gain on disposal in company P accounts and an adjustment of the financial investment in company B accounts for the same amount.

The goodwill that B has booked in its accounts when acquiring company A has been reversed and replaced by the goodwill corresponding to the acquisition of the  10%  in May.

Finally, we calculated a goodwill on company B only.

The good point in all this was the fact that we received individual accounts for companies A and B. Receiving consolidated accounts of the subgroup  \mathsf{B} + \mathsf{A} , for instance because B would have been located on another continent, would have resulted in a rather difficult consolidation process.
