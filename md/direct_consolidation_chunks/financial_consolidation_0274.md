## The adjustments = Year 3

At the end of Year 3, that asset is not in company A accounts any more. The problem is that the sale has been done based on a statutory value of 88 which is different from the value in consolidation of 80. For a given price of 120, the statutory profit is 32 and the consolidation profit is 40.

Here are the adjustments.


|   | A (Year 3) |  |  |  | Adjustment (z): Reverse the |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Asset (Acq. Val.) | 0 | Capital | 200 |   | sale which has been done on |
| (z) | 110 |   |   |   | the basis of values not |
| (b) | (10) |   |   |   | acceptable from a |
| (d) | (100) |   |   |   |   |
| Asset (Deprec.) | 0 | Reserves | (22) |   | consolidation point of view |
| (z) | (22) |   | (a) | 22 |   |
| (a) | 22 |   | (b) | (10) |   |
| (c) | (20) |   | (c) | (20) | Adjustment (a): Carry |
| (d) | 20 |   |   |   | forward the historical |
| Cash | 210 | Result | 32 |   | adjustment (a) of Year 2 |
| (z) | (120) |   | (z) | (32) | related to the reverse of the |
| (d) | 120 |   | (d) | 40 | depreciation of 22 |


Adjustment (b): Carry forward the historical adjustment (b) of Year 2 related to the reverse of the secondary costs of 10

Adjustment (c): Carry forwards the historical adjustment (c) of Year 2 related to the consolidation depreciation of 20

Adjustment (d): Make the sale in consolidation, based on a price of 120 and a net value of 80, giving a profit of 40.

Finally, we can see that assets and cash accounts are impacted for zero, the P&L for a profit of 8 and the Reserves for a debit of 8.

The final adjustments could just have been


|   | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Reserves | 8 |   |
| Result |   | 8 |


but a little bit more difficult to understand for inexperienced people.

Now, it can be interesting to compare the impact from a statutory point of view, supposing we adjust nothing, or from a consolidation point of view. Here is the summary.


|   | Year1 | Year2 | Year3 | Total |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Statutory | (11) | (11) | 32 | 10 |
| Consolidation | (20) | (10) | 40 | 10 |
