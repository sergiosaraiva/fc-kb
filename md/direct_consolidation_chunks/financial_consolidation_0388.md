This has to be considered as an intercompany difference on flows with some consequence on some consolidated disclosures.

The most important one impacted by this difference is the cash flow statement that will be studied later on in this Part 3. But, in the meantime, let's just consider that these intercompany flows of 100 and 70 will have to be eliminated, leaving a difference of 30. Speaking about a cash flow statement, the amounts of 100 and 70 are considered as cash amounts but not 30 which is non cash.

In order to avoid this kind of problem, it is necessary to book the following consolidation adjustment


| Company B | (in EUR) | Debit | Credit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Payables/A | Translation adjustment | 30 |   |
| Payables/A | Net variation |   | 30 |


reclassifying 30 between "Translation adjustment" flow and "Net variation" flow, leaving unchanged the closing amount of 100 which is correct.

Are you ready to book this kind of adjustment considering the number of differences that may occur in a group? While purchasing a consolidation software, the possibility to benefit from an automatic process would certainly be an advantage.
