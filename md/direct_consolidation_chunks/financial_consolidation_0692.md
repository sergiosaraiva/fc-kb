# The "expert" method

It is not recommended to use this method alone without verifying the result with one of two other methods.

It says that when disposing shares of a consolidated company to  3^{rd}  Parties, all amounts related to these shares and having impacted the group result have to be reversed by impacting the result again.

In our case study, a quarter  \((20% / 80%)\)  of the consolidated reserves of company A are aggregated results and so we have to reverse  704 = 2816  ( 20% / 80% ) which has to be considered as a debit in the P&L. But we also have a quarter of the impairments that have been booked in the P&L during the life time of the company in the consolidation scope. We speak about the amount of  50 = 200  ( 20% / 80% ) which will become a credit in the P&L.

The net amount in the P&L should then be  \((654) = (704) + 50\) .

This method doesn't indicate clearly which accounts have to be booked in P&L but the net amount is correct.
