## 6.3 Let's build a statutory cash flow statement

To do so the basic information comes from the flows on balance sheet accounts and from some non cash P&L accounts.

Here is the necessary information.


|   | Year 1 | Acq. | Disp. | Net var. | Dep. | Gain/disp. | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Tangible assets |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Acq.Val. | 7,000 | 3,000 | (1,200) |   |   | 200 | 9,000 |
| Deprec. | (1,000) |   |   |   | (600) |   | (1,600) |
| Fin. Invest. | 2,000 | 800 | (300) |   |   |   | 2,500 |
| Receivables | 1,200 |   |   | 400 |   |   | 1,600 |
| Cash | 800 |   |   | (300) |   |   | 500 |
| Total | 10,000 |   |   |   |   |   | 12,000 |



|   | Year 1 | Increase | Reimb. | Net var. | Prov. | Divid. | Approp. | Profit | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Capital | 3,000 | 1,000 |   |   |   |   |   |   | 4,000 |
| Reserves | 2,000 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 2,300 |
| Result | 500 |   |   |   |   |   | 300 | 400 | 400 |
| Provisions | 800 |   |   |   | 400 | (200) | (300) |   | 1,200 |
| Loans | 2,000 |   | (500) |   |   |   |   |   | 1,500 |
| Payables | 1,700 |   |   | 900 |   |   |   |   | 2,600 |
| Total | 10,000 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 12,000 |


For each balance sheet account, we explain in a financial or an accounting way what are the changes between opening and closing values.

As you can see, the reason of changes depends on the nature of each account and some flows are "cash" and so candidate to impact the cash flow statement while some others are "non cash". In the assets, flows considered as cash are "acquisitions", "disposals" and net variations". In the liabilities, flows considered as cash are 'Increase", Reimbursement", "Net variation" and "Dividends".

The 'Result" flow showing the Year 2 profit is ambiguous because it includes cash and non cash amounts as seen in the P&L


|   | Year 2 |
| --- | ---: |
| Turnover | 10,000 |
| Cost of sales | (8,800) |
| Depreciations | (600) |
| Provisions | (400) |
| Gain/disposals | 200 |
| Result | 400 |
