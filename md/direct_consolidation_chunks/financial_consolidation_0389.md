## 1.4 Flows related to asset disposal between companies

Another situation requires a particular attention which is explained by the following example. Let's consider company A selling a tangible asset (land) to

company B. This transaction is supposed to be done without any group profit, both companies are consolidated by the global integration method and have their accounts in consolidation currency.

Here is what we find in the bundle of each company and this looks "locally" correct.


|   | Year 1 | Acquisitions | Disposals | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Company A | 1,000 | 0 | (1,000) | 0 |
| Company B | 0 | 1,000 | 0 | 1,000 |


Once these figures are consolidated, their contribution gives this information.


|   | Year 1 | Acquisitions | Disposals | Year 2 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Consolidated | 1,000 | 1,000 | (1,000) | 1,000 |


showing a group having concluded two transactions with the outside world: one acquisition for 1000 and one disposal for 1000. That's totally wrong. The group did only an internal transaction that cannot be seen in the consolidated disclosures.

So what to do?

We recommend defining two 'Acquisitions" flows, one for transactions with  3^{rd}  Parties and one for transactions with other group companies and the same for the "Disposals" flow.

These group transaction flows can then just be ignored in the consolidated disclosures but, of course, the amounts must be checked as equal.

Let's now consider a similar situation with company B figures in a local currency (CUR). Both companies produce a bundle with the recommended group flows.


|   | Year 1 | Group acquisitions | Group disposals | Translation a. | Year 2 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | :--- | ---: |
| Company A | 1,000 | 0 | (1,000) |   | 0 |
| Company B (CUR) | 0 | 210 |   |   | 210 |
| Company B | 0 | 1,260 |   | (10) | 1,050 |


At acquisition time, the land is booked in company B accounts for an amount of 210 CUR, the local accountant using a day rate of 4.762.

A problem arises at the end of Year 2 because closing rate and average rate used for consolidation are 5 and 6 respectively. The last line of this report is showing company B information after currency translation with a Translation adjustment flow of 10.

If we just ignore this group transaction, we get a net value of  \(260 = 1260 + (1000)\)  that will be booked on an acquisition flow. This information has no economical background.

Again, we should reclassify 260 from the "Group acquisitions" flow to the "Translation adjustments" flow, in the same way we did in the previous example.
