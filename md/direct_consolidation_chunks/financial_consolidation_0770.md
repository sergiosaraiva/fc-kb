### Concerning the group structure

- We recommend to ask all information about the number of shares and not the percentages. This merge transaction will lead to the creation of new shares for the A+B entity (or the merged company) and

existing shareholders will exchange their A and B shares against A+B shares.

- Whatever the new percentage will be, the consolidated accounts after the merge

Either will integrate company A figures because the merged entity is consolidated by the global method  
Or company B figures will disappear because we consolidate the merged entity by the equity method. In any case, this merge will lead to a change of structure in the consolidated balance sheet and the P&L.

#### Concernina the statutory accounts

It is important to analyze and understand the statutory accounts before and after the merge transaction.

In consolidation, the equity of  A + B  must be equal to the sum of both equity of  A  and  B . If not, there may be dividends paid before the merge. In some countries, local regulations admit revaluation of assets when making the merge with an impact in the merged equity. If so, such revaluation must be reversed.

#### Concernina the consolidation adjustments

The main question is to decide what to do with all the historical adjustments, initially related to companies A and B, which have disappeared.

On the basis of our example, we recommend the following

Goodwills must be maintained. Moreover, we recommend keeping them separate even if we don't have two companies anymore but only a single one. Why? Because if in the future company A+B sells the activity related to the former A company, the goodwill attached to it should be eliminated.

- Revaluation of assets, and in a more general context, all adjustments booked in the two companies must be kept in the merged company in the same way that would have been the case in the individual companies.
