## Content

## Absorption Context:
This demonstrates absorption from a consolidation point of view where:
- P owns 100% of the shares of A
- A is consolidated with the global integration method
- The gain on absorption (300) appears as consolidation reserves
- Financial investment (700) < A's equity (1,000) = gain of 300


The consolidated reserves are equal to  300 = 100% * 1000 - 700

Beginning of Year 2, P decides to absorb company A. This means that all assets and liabilities belonging to company A are brought to company P, except the equity.

The financial investment owned by company P on company A has no reason to be maintained because the affiliate does not exist any more.

We show hereunder the journal entry (1) related to that absorption.
