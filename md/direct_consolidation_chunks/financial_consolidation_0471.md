## 4.1 On which accounts are calculated the Minority interests?

To answer the question as stated in the title of this section, we would just like to remind some useful properties with regard to Minority interests.

Minority interests are calculated on all items composing the equity as defined in section 3.1 of Part 3. By all items, we mean capital, reserves, result, badwill (depending on chosen rules), translation adjustments, grants, ...). In other words, we can calculate the Minority interests on the total equity.

Minority Interests are also calculated on financial investments.

To analyse Minority interests variations, we will need to identify the most important items that explain the equity variation between two successive periods.

Evolution of Minority interests may be analyzed through a status board as we did for the consolidated reserves but, unfortunately, as we will see, the columns are not as standard.

Anyway, we can try to identify the most important variations of equity as follows

Capital increase/decrease  
Result of the year  
Dividends paid  
- Movement on revaluation reserves (with no impact on result)  
Translation adjustments variation  
Variation of badwills  
Variation of grants

Moreover, we will have to take care of possible financial investments variations as acquisitions/disposals of shares on consolidated companies.

Finally, we will also consider companies in which the minority percentages may change between periods, including consolidation methods changes with no minority interests in one period and minority interests in the other one.
