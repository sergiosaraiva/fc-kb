### Answer 3.05

Option a: Not correct

Year 1 closing assets and liabilities will not impact the cash flow statement because they have not been acquired. The only cash out to show is the acquisition price of the shares giving the control on that company.

Option b: Not correct

A goodwill never appears in a cash flow statement. A goodwill is only a part of the transaction amount.

Option c: Not correct

This amount of 400 corresponding to the acquisition price less the goodwill is also a part of the acquisition price. It doesn't appear in the cash flow statement.

Option d: Correct

Whatever the consolidation method may be or the percentage acquired, the only amount impacting the cash flow statement is the acquisition price.
