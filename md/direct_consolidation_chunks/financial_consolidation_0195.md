The following accounts show that at the end of Year 1, company C makes a profit of 50 and a gross dividend of 20 is paid to the shareholders. At the end

of year 2, company C makes a profit of 40. Here are the accounts of parent and C companies.


| Parent |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| Investments | 160 | Capital | 500 |
|   |   | Reserves | 300 |
|   |   | Result | 100 |
| Assets | 1,030 | Liabilities | 250 |
| Total | 1,190 | Total | 1,150 |



| C at creation date (Year 1) |  |  |
| --- | --- | ---: |
|   | Capital | 200 |
|   | Reserves | 0 |
|   | Result | 0 |
| Assets | Liabilities | 0 |
| Total | 200 | 200 |


We will calculate successively the consolidated reserves of company C at creation date, at the end of year 1 and at the end of year 2 by applying three times the same formula.

At creation date, consolidated reserves are  0 = 80%  * 200 - 160.

At the end of Year 1, consolidated reserves  = 40 = 80%  [200 + 50] - 160, which is just the group profit of Year 1  [80% * 50] .


| C at the end of ear 1 |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Capital |  |  |
| Reserves |  |  |
| Result |  |  |
| Assets | 550 | Liabilities |
| Total | 550 | Total |


At the end of Year 2, consolidated reserves  = 56 = 80%  [200 + 30 + 40] - 160.


| C at the end of year 2 |  |  |  |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
|   |   | Capital | 200 |
|   |   | Reserves | 30 |
|   |   | Result | 40 |
| Assets | 670 | Liabilities | 400 |
| Total | 670 | Total | 670 |


The meaning of the 56 is the addition of the Year 1 and Year 2 profits for 40 and 32, minus the group dividends  = 16 = 80%  * 20.

So we can state that the consolidated reserves are just the accumulation of the group part in the result made each year by company C, less the dividends that are possibly paid during the same period.

That is also the reason why, at creation date, the consolidated reserves are zero, because no profit is made at that date.

After a certain number of years, we can also confirm that if the consolidated reserves are positive, the net contribution of the company in the group account is certainly a profit.
