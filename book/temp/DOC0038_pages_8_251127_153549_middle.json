First, let's carry forward the historical adjustments related to Year 1, Year 2 and Year 3. Then, the capital amount of 120 CUR must be split into 100 CUR and 20 CUR. For the 100 CUR, we apply the same rule: closing rate value of Year 4 - closing rate value of Year 3 = (40) = 140 - 180 which becomes a debit translation adjustment for 40 and a credit capital for 40. Finally, the capital increase for 20 has been translated at closing rate 1.4 instead of transaction rate 1.55, giving a difference of "
