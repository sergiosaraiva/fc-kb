Meanwhile, that land is now close to a highway access and located in a new and well-equipped activity area. The value of that land has been multiplied by three and the disposal to another group company would have two impacts: a huge gain in P&L and a corresponding revaluation of the land. But the transaction being made at market conditions, we eliminate nothing. We think the correct approach would be to eliminate the group profit and, possibly book a revaluation of the land to reflect a correct fair value with an impact in equity, not in the P&L."

In this approach, we would eliminate the profit in A accounts by booking a \"Deferred income\" account and, in company B accounts, the elimination of the profit in the asset would be done against a \"Deferred expense\" account. Both deferred accounts would be defined as intercompany accounts in order no to appear in the financial consolidated statement. Indeed, this is an internal group transaction that cannot appear in the accounts. Speaking about deferred accounts implies that these accounts must be closed sooner or later. Most of the time, the event will be the disposal of that asset finally to \\(3^{rd}\\) Parties. If this event cannot be predictable, the third approach should be used."
